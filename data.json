{"0": {"post": "it started with eddie martin. one second, he was at garvey\u2019s general, shooting the shit with the cashier. the next, he was gone. a whip crack-like noise signaled his departure; air rushing into a space that was previously occupied by a man. the glass bottle of cherry soda he was holding fell to the floor and smashed. the cashier looked dumbfounded. he ran through the store, seeing if anyone else was around to confirm what he had just witnessed. we all called him crazy at first. people don\u2019t just vanish into thin air. wasn\u2019t \u2018til garvey pulled up the cctv records that we started to believe it. one frame, there. the next, gone. drink all over the floor. most still thought it was fake, some dumb joke the three men were in on. lots of stuff could be done with computers nowadays; faking a video was easy. garvey insisted he had nothing to do with it though; whatever this was, it was all eddie. he was probably just hiding out somewhere laughing at all of us, garvey had said. then a day passed. and then two. long time to hide for a prank. the third day was when people really started getting worried. an suv drove through a red light on main street. went right through and into a pole. the driver\u2019s side seat was destroyed, would have probably killed the driver if there had been one. the car, however, was empty. sheriff lowery found the registration in the glove compartment. melissa gore, a teacher at the elementary school, was the owner and the second person to vanish. the sheriff\u2019s department searched the area for about an hour before shrugging their shoulders and towing the car to the impound lot. an hour after that, the mayor was on the radio announcing a town meeting to be held that night. word spread quickly; of both the second disappearance and of the meeting. whispers spread around town. eddie could be explained away as a dumb joke; he\u2019d show up eventually, right? it helped that he didn\u2019t have anyone to worry about him, he had a couple friends in town but that was it, mostly kept to himself. melissa was a different story. all the kids she taught, a husband, some family in town people would be looking for her. people would want to know what happened. the meeting was a shitshow, televised live on local channels for the viewing pleasure of those who couldn\u2019t make it. the mayor and sheriff walked out to a crowd that was yelling about fifty different theories for what the hell took those people. attempts to quell the crowd were futile until sheriff lowery cupped his hands to his face and boomed a \u201cquiet!\u201d. the mayor, mr. reeds, was at the microphone now and started. he stammered and sputtered about how our small town \u201cdidn\u2019t have the tools required to investigate these matters fully\u201d and how he was \u201ccalling in the big guns to help find these people\u201d. half the room erupted into curses and boos when he clarified that said \u201cbig guns\u201d were the united states government. he had said he contacted state police at first and it \u201cgot escalated surprisingly fast\u201d. no one wanted government types poking their noses in our business, but calmer heads recognized the necessary evil. we wanted our folks to be found, after all. a quick \u2018thank-you-goodbye\u2019 and mayor reeds was off the stage, along with the sheriff. it would be a long time till we would all head back to our homes, however. twenty different conversations erupted. an angry male voice was one of the easier ones to hear. \u201cwhy the hell are we letting the government come help?\u201d he said \u201cthey caused all this. teleportation experiment, got to be. just like that philadelphia thing.\u201d \u201cshut up, jimmy,\u201d a different voice retorted, \u201cit\u2019s aliens. gotta be aliens. i saw a ufo the other week when walking my dog. long, transparent thing with fins.\u201d and the two began to fight, calling each other all sorts of things that all boiled down to \u201ccrazy\u201d or \u201cstupid\u201d. in the back, a small group had begun to form around paul baker. he worked at the library; going through historical accounts and folklore was his hobby. \u201cthe land\u2019s no good,\u201d he said, shaking his head. \u201cthe hell\u2019s that mean?\u201d a voice from the crowd around him asked. \u201cbad land. bad things happen. when the european settlers came, they found this area completely unoccupied. big grassy open area next to a forest with a stream in it, perfect for a community. why wasn\u2019t it being used? remember when those kids from grithum came down that one summer? they were anthropology students. they said it was remarkable how empty the land was. no traces of native cultures at all; no arrowheads, no burial sites, hell, no pottery shards. the land was empty for a reason. it had to be.\u201d his crowd began to murmur at that. another group was forming on the other side of the room, this one headed by a handful of people. an older woman was talking the most (and the loudest). she was patricia hornley, a pta mom who stayed in it long after her daughter had finished school. she had a few of her other pta members around her and they were providing their own theory. \u201cdoes this not fall in line with the description of the rapture?\u201d she preached. \u201cwe assumed we would all get taken at once, but the lord works in mysterious ways. mrs. gore was an angel to her students, and she has been taken up into the kingdom of heaven. i embrace this slow rapture, and i am happy for those that are taken. i pray my turn comes soon.\u201d her crowd had a lot of the church-goers in it. they were all nodding with her, clapping in the pauses. i guessed it was comforting to them. i didn\u2019t stay long after that. paul baker had left that night. he went straight home, packed up, and was out to his car in about 30 minutes.. his neighbors asked where he was gonna go, what he was gonna do. \u201cup north, jersey,\u201d he replied, \u201ci got family up there, i\u2019ll get a job there.\u201d and he was gone. guess he spooked himself with \u201cbad land\u201d talk. he was leaving lots behind. mayor reeds\u2019s \u201cbig guns\u201d came in the morning.we had gathered near garvey\u2019s general; we had all agreed last night that it would be a good idea to make sure no one vanished overnight. families and couples sent one member each if they didn\u2019t all come. we had just finished confirming that we didn't lose anyone to the slow rapture (it was a good name, i had to give patricia that) when we heard the roaring of many engines. we watched as big, dark green trucks drove into our small town. there were five of them, all the same bulky suv. each had a decal on the driver door; a seal for some kind of government department. it showed a woman with a sword in one hand and a struggling snake in the other. yellow words circled the seal and read: bureau of interior management b.i.m the convoy came to a stop at the store. we watched from the parking lot as the door of the middle car swung open. a large man hopped out and in the same swift motion closed the door behind him. he was dressed in a black jumpsuit covered with pouches and belts. the same seal from the car door was embroidered on the back. he walked up to us, smiling, and asked us where mayor reeds might be. someone pointed him out and the man thanked us. mayor reeds, sheriff lowery, and the man in the black jumpsuit stepped to the side and started talking. we all tried to listen in, and bits and pieces came through. \u201cjust what the hell is the \u2018bureau of interior management\u2019?\u201d mayor reeds asked. \u201ci thought we\u2019d get the fbi or something.\u201d the man in the black jumpsuit, still grinning, put a large hand on the mayor\u2019s shoulder and replied. he spoke in a quieter voice than reeds did; we couldn\u2019t hear a thing. he turned to the sheriff and said something. \u201clisten, pal,\u201d lowery began, \u201ci was under the impression this was going to be a joint effort. where i come from that means \u2018work together\u2019 not \u2018i\u2019m king of the playground, listen to me.\u2019\u201d the man in the black jumpsuit spoke louder in his reply this time, glancing at us. he was making sure we could hear this part. \u201cyour impression was wrong. as of five hours ago, in-fact, complete control over this investigation has been passed over to me. any interference in my investigation and i will send you all the way to fucking attica, do not pass go, do not collect $200. do you understand me?\u201d his eyes wandered to our group at the end. that goes for all of you too, they said. lowery stammered, five different words trying to come out while reeds just looked at the asphalt like a scolded child. \u201cgood!\u201d the man in the black jumpsuit practically spun on his heels to face the crowd. \u201cany motels in this little town?\u201d a man raised his hand. he wore a baseball cap and had a beer gut. \u201cwe got one. i own it. it\u2019s just down the road a little ways.\u201d \u201cgreat! me and my boys are gonna borrow it for a few days while we investigate this little issue your town\u2019s got. you don\u2019t mind, do ya?\u201d the same shit-eating grin was on his face. \u201cwell, i don\u2019t know, i mean\u2026\u201d \u201coh! wait a minute.\u201d the large man held up a finger and dug into a pouch around his hip with his other hand. he pulled out an envelope. reaching in, he produced a wad of bills that looked like they had just gotten out of the mint that day. not a wrinkle in sight. \u201cthis should cover it.\u201d he handed the motel owner the wad of bills. he turned again to face his convoy of cars. the man performed a hand motion, reached over to the walkie-talkie on his shoulder, and whispered a few words into it. the convoy began moving towards the direction of the motel. the man in the black jumpsuit walked back over to the sheriff and mayor. \u201cnow,\u201d he said, putting an arm on each of their shoulders, \u201cwhere can i find the car that nice woman disappeared in?\u201d the bim guys had become a part of our town for the next few days. we got used to seeing them, walking in pairs, holding machines in their hands they would use to gather reading or something like that. their uniform was very similar to the large man\u2019s; the only difference was that theirs was green. black jumpsuit (he hadn\u2019t given his name) said that we should continue the morning headcount meetings. a man from the bureau would join us there now, and if anyone was missing he would call it in and they would send men to the scene to check. thats what happened when mayor reeds didn\u2019t show up to one of the headcounts. the man in the green jumpsuit talked into his shoulder radio when we did the count. then he was in his car and driving to mayor reeds\u2019s house. the rest of us looked at each other. we followed. what else were we to do? \u201cfalse alarm.\u201d one of the men in green was saying as i pulled up. they were packing their gear back up into their trucks. \u201che\u2019s not gone?\u201d i asked. \u201coh, he\u2019s gone,\u201d the man replied, \u201conly not like the other two. he skipped town. his car\u2019s missing. wallet probably too.\u201d reeds was probably smart for that. smarter than me. i don\u2019t know why i stayed. i thought about that on the drive back to my house. maybe i thought i was special. that whatever happened to eddie and melissa wouldn\u2019t happen to me. maybe, deep down, i believed patrica\u2019s take. that this was some holy rapture, taking the good to heaven. i wasn\u2019t religious much myself nowadays but i grew up going to church every week and, well, that stuff sticks in your head. or maybe it was simpler than that. maybe it was the same reason everyone else was staying around. maybe it was just a want\u2014 no, a need. a deep, primal need to see this through to the end\u2014 to get an answer. i passed the elementary school on the way back. the big sign out front with those removable black letters read: we miss you melissa! a cork board near to it had drawings pinned on it, all of her. her students must\u2019ve done \u2018em. they all had messages similar to the one on the big sign. there were a few students playing outside on the grass. recess i guessed. they were playing some version of tag, screaming and hollering. \u201cthe hungry spirit\u2019s coming for you!\u201d the kid who was \u201cit\u201d yelled. \u201cone by one! one by one, gonna geeettt everyone!\u201d. i shivered a bit. children could turn anything into games, especially tragedy. isn\u2019t that what ring-around-the-rosie was about, after all? life went on. we lost some people as the days went by. sheriff lowery was one. a few other townspeople too. it became hard to tell who was vanishing and who was just leaving town in the middle of the night. the bim people abandoned their motel base overnight. they now sat on the outskirts of the town, with tents at first then then a bigger, prefabricated building they got sent in from god knows where. a few of us went to investigate. the owner of the place was one of the ones who ditched town; probably did it that day he got that wad of cash from the black jumpsuit man. peeking in through the windows, we found that every room was what you\u2019d expect. just motel rooms, if a bit messy. only one room was different. an olive green bag was on the floor. black boots still lay by the bed. equipment was on the table. looked like one of the bim guys got raptured; must\u2019ve spooked the others. the bim guy at the next headcount was wearing a full white hazmat suit. guess they thought it would protect them from whatever was going on. hell, maybe it would. the black jumpsuit man was also there, though he wore a similar white hazmat this time. \u201cstill think it\u2019s them doing it, jimmy?\u201d a man asked.\u201dgovernment teleportation? look at \u2018em; they\u2019re spooked. it aint them. i\u2019m telling you, it\u2019s aliens.\u201d there weren\u2019t too many of us left now. mostly it was patrica\u2019s group. the ones who truly believe those that disappeared were getting taken up to heaven. she was preaching outside now; the town was empty enough that no one really cared. most others had the sense to leave. others who stayed were the families of the missing, hoping that the bim guys might figure something out, might be able to bring them back. a very small handful were fools like me. staying to see this to the end. black jumpsuit looked at the crowd and cleared his throat. \u201cwe just need a few more days,\u201d he announced, \u201cwe\u2019re close to figuring this all out.\u201d \u201cwe know what\u2019s going on!\u201d screeched patricia. a chorus of agreement came from her followers. \u201cit\u2019s beyond you, and it\u2019s a good thing! it\u2019s a beautiful process!\u201d black jumpsuit held his hands up in front of him in defense while still smiling. \u201cwhatever you say, ma\u2019am.\u201d he looked at the rest of us. we nodded. a few more days. we\u2019d find out what was going on. patrica would be the last town member taken. she was outside, preaching again one day when that whip-crack sound came and she was gone. the crowd stood still for a moment and then erupted into cheers. she got what she wanted, what they all wanted. she had been taken up. the bim people were there quick. they all wore the full white hazmat suits now. they scanned members of the crowd with their equipment and took their readings. one of the people in the crowd was recording the sermon on their phone; they had captured the whole thing. before anyone could watch it, though, the phone was taken by one of the bim people. her followers decided that they\u2019d have a party in the school auditorium to celebrate her ascension. food and drinks, movies on the big projector, the whole nine yards. even us non believers went; what else was there to do in town anymore? it sounded like it might be a good time, anyway. tables were set up in the back with bowls of food and drink. the projection screen was lowered, and images of patricia were being slideshowed on it, all with text that said things like \u201ccongratulations!\u201d. no one knows who did it. it had to be someone from the bim, someone who had a crisis of conscience. we\u2019ll never know their name, though. suddenly the room went dark. there were a few gasps of surprise. then the projection changed. instead of the images of patricia, now it was a white text on a black background that read: you have been lied to and then the next slide: the missing are dead some more gasps from the crowd form that. somewhere, a woman said \u201cbullshit\u201d. deep down, though, some of us knew. and the next slide would convince everyone. it was the cell phone footage of patrica\u2019s rapture. it played normally at first. preaching, whip-crack, gone. but the cell phone had a higher fps than the old cctv at garvey's. the footage played again and slowed as it got closer to the moment, eventually going frame-by-frame. \u201cchrist!\u201d cried a man when we saw it. a child started to cry. a man whose child got raptured broke down, something deep inside breaking in his cries. most of us were silent in the revelation. in one frame, patricia was mid-sentence, mouth open, finger pointing. she was in the same pose in the next frame, and it looked normal until you got to her head. it looked as if a scoop had been taken to the right side of her face, the layers displayed like a half-sucked jawbreaker. skin gave way to meat, meat to bone, bone to brain, brain to nothing. like something had taken an impossibly smooth bite out of her. and i knew it wasn\u2019t possible. it happened to her so fast, it couldn\u2019t be. but i could have sworn her mouth had changed slightly. i could have sworn it was curling into a scream now. my mind flashed back. bad land? maybe. hungry spirits, closer. but, god, it felt like the air itself was hungry. we all left town after that. no one spoke a word. i passed the bim base on the drive out. i locked eyes with black jumpsuit. for once, he wasn\u2019t smiling. i think they wanted guinea pigs. wanted to see how often the thing needed to eat, see if they could control it. fuck that. i\u2019ve been out of south carolina for a while now. i still look, though. i still look at the area. our little town got taken off the maps recently. why wouldn\u2019t it be? no one lived there anymore. i look at missing people reports though. and people still go missing around there. abandoned cars found in the middle of the road or careened off the side. our town was always a drive-through area. town\u2019s off the map, but roads still get used. i hope it\u2019s enough. i hope the thing is satisfied. i hope to god it doesn't spread.", "audio": "audios/0.wav", "tokens": ["it started with eddie martin.", "one second, he was at garvey\u2019s general,

connection and started dating 3 days later. she brought nothing but happiness, the perfect definition of a soulmate. so when i graduated from university, we both agreed to move in together. she\u2019s 2 years older than me and was already working, so i moved in to her house. however, after moving in, everything went downhill. the first incident happened on the first night of moving in. victoria works night shift, so she was getting ready to head out. \u201cbabe, i\u2019m off to work now. just to tell you again, the neighbors next door get a little cranky at night so just ignore them.\u201d she said sweetly. \u201cyeah, yeah, i get it.\u201d i responded. i gave her a kiss goodbye and she left, leaving me alone in her house. i sat down on the kitchen table and got to work (for context, i work remotely as a character designer for a video game company). it was peaceful for a few hours until the clock hit 2am. the cranky neighbors began screaming profusely. i couldn\u2019t hear what they were saying, but it sounded like an intense argument. i tried ignoring it for a while, but eventually the sound became unbearable. banging was heard on the walls, glass shattering on the floor, followed by more screaming and arguing. so much so that it sounded like multiple voices overlapping each other. i tried blasting music in my headphones, but that didn\u2019t help. eventually i couldn\u2019t take it anymore, so i called it a night and stopped working. the next day passed by in a flash. i chose not to tell victoria about the neighbors since it was apparently normal and i didn\u2019t want her to think that it bothered me so much. it was her house after all. night time came and i was watching tv in the sofa when the arguments from the neighbors came again. thumping, glass shattering, furniture being thrown around, you\u2019d think their house is a wwe ring. \u201cjesus christ.\u201d i muttered to myself. suddenly, i started hearing banging on the door, followed by a blood-curdling scream. \u201cwhat the fuck?!\u201d i said while pausing the movie i was watching. the neighbor was trying to break in to the house. that's it. that was the last straw. i got up and went to the back door where the banging and screaming was being heard. i grabbed a knife from the kitchen table in case the man would break the door. thank god it was locked. just in case, i leaned against it, each punch crushing my back. my heart was racing, my hands were shaking. i didn\u2019t know what to do. for all i knew, the man could seriously hurt me. it felt like an eternity before what i\u2019m assuming is a man stopped banging the door. concurrently, the screaming stopped, and it was silent. \u201cthe fuck\u2026\u201d i muttered under my breath. there was no way i was going to live in these conditions. i decided that i was going to confront victoria about it when she got home. with that in mind, i made sure all the doors were locked, windows shut, and went to bed. a few hours later at 6am, my girlfriend got home and laid down in the bed next to me. she hugged me from behind and gave me a kiss on the nape, waking me up. \u201chow\u2019s everything?\u201d she asked softly. \u201cwere the neighbors loud?\u201d i grunted and turned my head to face her, rubbing my eyes. \u201cwhat?\u201d victoria giggled. \u201chow did it go with the neighbors?\u201d i found it strange that she asked me that today but not yesterday. maybe it was me being tired. \u201cthe husband tried breaking in.\u201d i said. \u201che banged on the door for at least 2 minutes, screaming. i thought that was the end for me. seriously victoria, i don't think this house is safe for us to live in.\" \u201cas long as the door is locked you should be fine.\u201d she smiled, sweetly. i gave victoria a serious look. \u201clisten, i can\u2019t live with these conditions.\u201d i tried to say it as nicely as possible. \u201ci didn\u2019t even feel safe in this house last night. you\u2019re telling me this is going to happen every single night?\u201d victoria looked down, her eyelids drooping down in discomfort. i felt sorry blaming her for something that wasn\u2019t her fault, but we obviously needed to do something about it. i can\u2019t fear for my life every night. \u201ci\u2019ll call the wife tonight and see if anything can be done.\u201d she hugged me tightly. \u201cok?\u201d i smiled and kissed her forehead. \u201cthank you baby. i know it's not your fault, but it's impossible to live in fear in my own house every night.\" on the following evening, victoria left for her nightshift. once again i was left alone in her house. she texted me around 15 minutes later, telling me that the problem was solved and that it should be better tonight. i thanked her and laid down on the sofa to wind down. i ended up falling asleep while watching a movie. i woke up a few hours later at 4am to screaming from the psychotic neighbors once again. furious, i got out of bed and prepared myself for confrontation. i was ready to finally get to the bottom of this. however, as i walked closer to the front door, something felt off. i noticed the voices and banging a little closer than usual. as if they were in the same house. it was the first time i ever paid attention to where the sound was truly coming from, but it was still unexpected. subtle, but unexpected. following the traces of sound, the screams didn\u2019t take me to the front entrance, or to the house next door. they took me to the basement door, the only part of the house i haven\u2019t gone into yet. my heart began racing. this has to be my hallucinations. the sounds can\u2019t be coming from my girlfriend\u2019s basement\u2026right? with my legs trembling, i tried to push the basement door open, but it was locked. it only resulted in even louder screams coming from downstairs. they sounded like a cry for help. \u201cwhat the fuck is down there?\u201d i muttered. the thought alone sent shivers down my spine. thankfully (or unthankfully), my uncle taught me lock picking when i was younger in case i was in a dangerous situation where i needed it (thanks uncle will). so if there has ever been an opportunity to use that skill, it would be now. i took 2 paper clips and started fidgeting them inside of the lock. in just a few minutes, the door unlocked, but it still wouldn\u2019t open. i looked around the house for anything i could use, until i found a crowbar. using all my might, i pushed the door open. looking back, i wish i hadn\u2019t. instantly, i heard loud, bloodcurdling screams piercing my ears. screams that you would only hear in horror movies. covering my ears, i forced my way downstairs. what i saw was horrific. dead bodies of dozens of guys were organized in a line on the floor across the basement. worst of all, every guy there looked to be around my age, many looking like the exes victoria had talked about in passing. above them was a jar. inside it looked to be their faces with a large glow surrounding them. they were screaming in absolute, agonizing pain. from what i saw, it looked to be their souls. the sealed, trapped souls of innocent men facing endless pain in their afterlife. the stench was unbearable. their bodies were bled out, as if everything inside of these men were sucked out to leave only their pure skin. despite that, their faces were somewhat recognizable, each body neatly placed to keep its original shape. their names were written in blood in front of each body: jack. noah. michael. etc. their screams sounded more like loud gasps from up close. the room was so loud i was getting dizzy. the screams only got louder, its sound loud enough to screech into my brain. my mind went blank, my body shaking at the thought that this was my girlfriend\u2019s creation. it got even worse when i got to the end. another name written in blood, with no body behind it, as if it was still being prepared: dylan. that was my name. i then got a notification on my phone. a message from victoria. my heart stopped just by reading it. \u201chey babe, omw home! sorry about yesterday. lets have some fun

case anyone's asking, my mom married three different people, so growing up i was raised with three different dads. all nine of us were close. we were essentially inseparable. growing up we fought school bullies together, helped each other with our homework, and even formed a rock band at some point, though that didn't last long it started three weeks ago. i was in class when i got the notification that lucas had been killed in a car accident. i remember the funeral vividly. no tears, nothing. just a weird sense of dread and emptiness. after the funeral, me and my siblings sat in silence. we didn't feel sad, we didn't cry. we just felt a sense of dread and impending doom. throughout the next two weeks my siblings began dying under mysterious circumstances. amy was strangled by a power cord after fixing something in her house with her husband, michael was crushed by a falling tree, june was electrocuted in her basement during a thunderstorm, tex suffered a fatal heart attack while in his home, jackson fell off the roof of his home while fixing roof tiles, and nick choked on food while eating dinner with his family. throughout all this, i began experiencing and seeing weird shit happen around me. stuff around my house began to disappear and reappear, crows were now crashing into my window, dogs began weirdly avoiding my home, and mysterious figures began staring at me outside my home. in addition to all this, i developed sleep paralysis, a condition i never had up to this point. as the deaths continued, i decided to visit my mom. she wasn't the greatest mom. she often spent her days at the bar and engaged in one night stands while my dads were left to clean up the mess, so i grew up resenting her. as i rang the doorbell, i felt the same sense of impending doom i felt while at lucas's funeral. soon, my mom opened the door and stifled a sob when she saw me. she attempted a hug, but i pushed her away. \"can i come in?\" i asked. my mom nodded and made some coffee while i sat awkwardly on her couch. as she set down the coffee, i decided to ask her something out of the blue. \"mom, these deaths..are they connected somehow?\" my mom stopped, and dropped the coffee cup. the cup smashed onto the ground as she slowly sat down. \"i think..it's time i tell you the truth\" my mom said. as i listened, my mom explained the truth behind my sibling's deaths see, i had an ancestor, nicholas rightson, who was a bank manager back in the day. however, he was secretly defrauding the very people he was helping, and he managed to get away with nearly 6 million dollars. one night, he was approached by a mysterious demon, who had intended to take his soul. however, nicholas made a deal with the demon: he was going to take the souls of 20 of his relatives, and in exchange, the demon would spare his soul. the only problem was, nicholas failed in his mission. he only killed twelve: his parents, his brothers, sisters, grandma, and grandpa, and his soul was collected as a result. now, the demon was killing off my siblings to collect the rest of the souls. for some strange reason, i instantly believed the story my mom had told me. i slowly sat up, thanked my mom for the coffee, and left the house shaken. as i left, i got the final text: martin had drowned on a weekend getaway with his friends. the same sense of impending doom and dread hit me as i realized that i had been spared from whatever this demon was doing, but that for some reason, it decided to toy with me just for the hell of it. it's been exactly three weeks since all my

engineer called in the incident on the radio.\u201d i\u2019ve been a train conductor for the past nine years. my old man had been a conductor as well, and retired last year after forty years on the job. he urged me to apply after a failed detour through college and a handful of odd jobs. it\u2019s a good living, he said. decent pay, good benefits, and a pension. there were a few downsides: the long hours, dealing with some difficult passengers, and monotonous routines. i didn\u2019t mind the work though; i finally had enough seniority to hold a run that i liked, and it paid well enough that i didn\u2019t need to put in much overtime to make ends meet. the other downside, the one that every railroader dreads, is dealing with their train hitting somebody. statistically, most conductors and engineers will have at least one incident in their career. my father had three. he told me about his first one, a young woman who stepped out in front of his train in an apparent suicide. the thing he\u2019ll never forget, he said, was that all of the victims were knocked clear out of their shoes from the force of the collision. he explained that the impacts usually occurred in one of two ways: the victim would either be struck by the plow on the front of the locomotive and be thrown like a rag doll, or they would go underneath the train and get crushed and cut to pieces by the wheels. the latter was obviously more grisly. it was horrible for the whole crew; the engineer would throw the brakes into emergency knowing that there was nothing they could do as they watched their train smash into the person. the conductor would have to get out on the tracks to search for the body. this was my last trip of the night. it was slow, and we had maybe a dozen or so passengers on board. normally i would have had an assistant conductor with me, but he had called out sick and the company didn\u2019t assign me a replacement for the evening. we were about seven minutes out from our last stop when

to the barn. when i got there, a barrel-chested dog came running out and started barking at me. i wasn\u2019t intimidated\u2013 rudy\u2019s big as a bear\u2013 and i stuck out my hand so he could sniff me. \u201cc\u2019mere, amos,\u201d a voice called, and the dog lumbered inside. \u201chey, how\u2019s it going?\u201d said a tall butch woman. she wore thick work gloves and coveralls, and was leading a brown horse to its stall. \u201cyou must be maeve.\u201d \u201ci\u2019m alright,\u201d i said, watching her take off the horse\u2019s bridle. \u201care you helen?\u201d \u201cthat\u2019s me, but you can call me hel.\u201d the stall door whined on its hinges as hel closed it. \u201cso, training!\u201d she clapped her gloved hands together. \u201cgot any experience working with horses?\u201d \u201cno, actually. but i\u2019m happy to learn.\u201d \u201ci\u2019ll be honest with you\u2013 it\u2019s hard work. especially the evening shift. but you\u2019ll get better with time.\u201d \u201cwhat\u2019s wrong with the evening shift?\u201d hel paused, staring off into the distance. \u201cit\u2019s just different. different responsibilities.\u201d she opened up another stall. \u201cthis here is walter. i\u2019m gonna teach you how to muck his stall so you can get started right away.\u201d walter was pale white with grayish spots. he nickered softly when hel ducked into his stall. \u201cyou\u2019re gonna need a pitchfork and a wheelbarrow. all you do is sift the hay and look for the dirty stuff. when in doubt, toss it.\u201d she scooped some soiled hay into a wheelbarrow to demonstrate. \u201cif you need to move him, just give him a firm push. and never sneak around his backside or you\u2019ll get kicked. you gotta let him know you\u2019re there, like this.\u201d hel placed a hand on walter\u2019s hindquarters while she moved behind him. i nodded along, throwing in a cursory mhm or got it to show hel i was listening. it looked easy enough and i was eager to try. \u201cwhen your wheelbarrow is full, take it to the pile and dump it.\u201d hel pointed to a mound of hay outside, steaming in the cold. \u201cremember to refill the beds with fresh hay.\u201d she showed me where the hay bales were, and which ones were for eating and bedding. \u201conce you\u2019re done mucking, you\u2019re gonna feed and water the horses. there\u2019s a whiteboard by the office that tells you what each horse eats. walter and hercules get alfalfa, and duchess gets steamed hay. it\u2019s very important to remember that. messes with their stomachs if they get the wrong food.\u201d next hel told me how to refill the water buckets. \u201cbe sure to hook them on the right way. the horses can catch their eyelid if you don\u2019t.\u201d \u201cthis all seems doable,\u201d i told her. \u201ccan i try a stall now?\u201d hel chuckled. \u201cthere\u2019s a few more things you have to know before you start.\u201d \u201cok. what is it?\u201d \u201clike i said, the evening shift is different. i need you to count the horses when you\u2019re done. make sure every stall has a horse. if anyone is missing, they\u2019re probably outside. let me know and i\u2019ll bring them in.\u201d i glanced around the barn. there were eight stalls in all. a lot to muck, especially for a beginner. i was ready to get calluses on my hands. \u201cand be careful around the woods.\u201d hel got that faraway look in her eyes again. \u201cit gets dark here.\u201d the stables bordered a dense tangle of woods. i\u2019d smoked there a few times, but i never went very deep. \u201csounds like common sense,\u201d i said. hel handed me her pitchfork. \u201cready to start?\u201d \u201cready.\u201d \u201cif you need anything, come get me. i\u2019ll be in the office.\u201d i started with walter's stall. when i stepped in, he started sniffing me. \u201cmy coat isn\u2019t food,\u201d i scolded him when he lipped my zipper. i spotted some shit in the corner and began scooping. working next to walter complicated things. i hesitated to push him around, worrying he\u2019d bite or kick me. luckily, he was docile and shuffled aside every time. my wheelbarrow quickly filled up. i took it to the pile, a few yards from the barn. the acrid smell stung my nostrils. emptying the wheelbarrow took some effort. i couldn\u2019t get out all the hay in one try, so i used my pitchfork for the rest. then i heard a noise from the distance. a low whistle, like blowing into something hollow. it sounded like it was coming from the woods. i wasn\u2019t idiotic enough to go investigate it. i took the wheelbarrow back to the barn, ignoring the fear humming through me. the next step was replacing the hay. with a pair of rusty scissors, i cut open the thick cords binding the bales together. i grabbed one flake, two flakes, and shook them vigorously around the stall, until i couldn\u2019t see the bottom of the bed. after that, i had to feed walter. he got two flakes of alfalfa, which scratched up my hands. walter began chewing at it before i could even lay it down. \u201cwhoa, be patient.\u201d while he was occupied, i emptied his water. the buckets were heavy. i felt a twinge in my back as i carried them, and knew i\u2019d be sore the next morning. i dumped them out on the pavement like hel said. again, the same whistle came from the woods. i could swear it sounded closer. walter snorted loudly behind me. \u201cit\u2019s ok,\u201d i tried soothing him. it was probably a wild animal, like a fox or coyote. a good reason to avoid the woods. i stepped back in the stall and saw the fresh hay was stained. walter had pissed while i was gone. \u201cdamn it, walter. i just replaced that.\u201d he was standing right against the wall. his ears were held back, and he looked tense. i went to the office to update hel on my progress. \u201ci finished walter\u2019s stall. what should i do next?\u201d hel was standing at a whiteboard, drawing up a chart. \u201cjust do duchess for now. you\u2019re still training. once you get more experience, i\u2019ll work you harder.\u201d duchess was the brown horse i saw earlier. her coat was short and sleek. \u201chey, girl,\u201d i greeted her. she had the same anxious stance as walter, and her stall was even dirtier. most of the hay was soaked with piss. i got to clearing it out. as i did, i thought about gertie, her peeling paint plastered with dozens of bumper stickers. $25 an hour did seem ridiculous for mucking stalls, but with that kind of pay, i\u2019d be able to diagnose the mysterious rattling sound she made whenever i drove too fast. not to mention i could visit the salon and touch up my blue-streaked hair, which had faded to a seasick greenish hue. the thought motivated me to keep dutifully cleaning duchess\u2019s stall. i followed the routine of emptying my wheelbarrow. at the hay pile, i listened for the whistling noise, but didn\u2019t hear it. the stables were quiet. no sound but the rustling of hay. the steamed hay was kept in a wheelbarrow on the other side of the barn. i went to grab a few flakes. amos started growling behind me. \u201cmanners,\u201d hel called from the office. he was sitting in the aisle, eyes fixated on something i couldn\u2019t see. his tail was tucked between his legs. probably some wild animal again, i decided. rudy always fussed at the foxes out in the yard. i scattered the steamed hay, dumped duchess\u2019 water buckets, filled them with the hose. the stall looked luxurious for what it was. \u201ci\u2019m finished with duchess too,\u201d i told hel. \u201cgreat. do the head count, and you\u2019re good to go.\u201d i walked along the aisle, making sure there was a horse in each stall. walter, duchess, hercules, luna, barnaby, captain, bonnie, gandalf. eight horses, every stall occupied. amos started growling again. his throaty rumbles turned into barks. around me, the horses whinnied, sharply blowing out air. walter banged on the door with his hoof like he was trying to break out. duchess was shrieking. i looked around to see what was disturbing them. outside, there was another horse. it stumbled like a newborn foal as it aimlessly circled the pasture. its legs seemed too thin and too long for its body. i could see the outline of every rib. the whites of its eyes were visible from every angle. they looked almost human. i thought i heard it faintly whinnying, but as i listened closer, it sounded more like whistling. \u201cmaeve!\u201d hel shouted. suddenly she was pulling me away from the pasture, gripping my arm so hard it hurt. \u201cfuck,\u201d she swore under her breath. \u201ci should have told you.\u201d \u201ctold me what?\u201d my heart thudded in my chest. \u201cyou counted the horses, right?\u201d \u201cyeah, they\u2019re all in their stalls.\u201d \u201cwe only have eight.\u201d hel said breathlessly. a cold feeling stirred through me. goosebumps budded all over my

younger brother scott had always been the black sheep of the family. he was hanging around bad influences, and even got a month suspension for drugs in high school. my parents tried desperately to change his behavior. he spent more time grounded than not, and they even threatened him with military school. i tried to be there for him, but he was always cold and distant. when we graduated college, he didn\u2019t want to stick around. the last time i saw him was on christmas, he didn\u2019t speak or even look at my parents the whole time. they didn\u2019t get him anything either. after that he took his car and drove out west before cutting contact with everyone. i never stopped missing him, and i always prayed every night that he\u2019d find the right path. a few years past, and my mom passed from lung cancer just a few months before i graduated college. her condition and death sent my dad into a depression, and he turned to drinking. he drank himself to the grave just a few years after that. the loss of my parents was hard, and all i could think about was how i wanted my brother here to help. i wondered if he knew, or even cared, given how he never had a good relationship with our parents. ten years had passed since i last saw scott, and things hadn\u2019t gotten much better for me. my wife of five years had turned out to be having an affair, leaving me alone and heartbroken. i was struggling financially, having trouble holding down jobs, and suffering from alcohol abuse just my father had. however, the light did shine down on me, and one day i received a letter from scott. i was in disbelief, my brother who cut contact a decade ago was now reaching out to me. the letter read as follows: \u201cdear avery, it is me, your brother, scott. i know it has been long, and we parted not on the best terms. as such, i want to repay you, as i have sensed your heartbreak, your turmoil, and your dipsomania. i reach out my hand as invitation into the new family which has granted me great comfort and courage when i too was struggling and directionless. please accept my offer, and we kin will be reunited again under its glorious radiance. -your brother, scott\u201d the message struck me as a bit odd at first. it was a while since i talked to him, but i knew he didn\u2019t talk like that. but something in me chose only to look past it. i couldn\u2019t describe it, but i felt like i was being saved, that this letter would be what saves my life. i checked the address on the envelope, which was five states away. something was pulling me, guiding me, and i couldn\u2019t ignore it. so i scraped up as much money as i could and took a one way trip to see my brother once more. deep in my gut i knew, the glorious radiance was guiding me. after a grueling trip i had arrived at the address. i stood before a giant iron gate, and through the bars i could see several small buildings, with one big building in the center. between them was only grass and trees, with no visible paths or roads. i could see people wearing pure white robes traversing between the buildings. a small group approached the gate, and leading them was my brother scott. scott too wore a white robe, he had always been skinny, but now he was gaunt, and so was everyone else there. they also had really dark circles around their eyes, as if nobody had slept in days. i couldn\u2019t help but be put off by their appearance, but soon i would see how blind i was. \u201cwelcome to our paradise brother.\u201d scott greeted me. i could barely let out a word before i hurried over and hugged him. wrapping my arms around him really let me feel how thin he was, as he wrapped his bony arms around my neck. we stood there talking about the past ten years, how we were holding up, how good it was to see each other after so long. scott told me these people took him in after he had found himself wandering aimlessly around the country, how they offered him everything he needed, and how he knew i needed them too. \u201chow did you know i needed help? we haven\u2019t spoken in so long?\u201d i asked \u201cthe light showed me, told me that i must find you, that it would save you like it saved me.\u201d i was confused, i had no idea what he was talking about, frankly i thought it was damn freaky. i had known about groups like this, but i was ignorant, and deep down i knew this was the true path i needed to take. i accepted their offer, and they closed the gate behind me. i followed them further into the compound as they lead me to their leader. i saw many people in prayer circles, chanting in the radiant hymns that i would have the great privilege of learning. standing in the center of a large circle was the voice of radiance. his robe was white with golden trims and reached down to the ground, covering his feet. he wore a large hood, and under the hood was a blank golden mask. the other members knew to bow before him, and i followed suit. \u201cso you have brought another whom seeks the warmth of the glorious radiance. who is he, i must ask?\u201d he said, his voice muffled but no less powerful. \u201che is my brother, oh great voice, the great light showed me his strife, and has guided him here.\u201d scott spoke, only raising his head and nothing more. the voice turned to me, even from behind the golden mask, his gaze commanded me to rise. \u201cchild in darkness, tell me, do you wish to be embraced by the glorious radiance? to know its hymns and execute its will?\u201d i rose to my feet, \u201ci do.\u201d \u201crise, followers of the light! tonight we perform the severance!\u201d the voice demanded, raising his arms into the air, i knew there was no going back. for my initiation, they performed a ritual called \u201cthe severance\u201d. in the severance, one must discard all their belongings, and incinerate them. this ensures that the one who chooses to live in the light can enjoy its splendor without burden. they had me take my clothes off, as long with anything in my pockets, my wallet, my phone, my house and keys, everything. \u201care you ready to be unburdened? to be free? to the know the light, and only the light? to care for the light, and only the light?\u201d the voice of radiance asked me. \u201cyes! with all my heart!\u201d i shouted. with my confirmation, they tossed my things into the pyre. the fire burned hotter, the warmth spreading over my naked body as i took in my newfound weightlessness. soon, two other members draped me in another one of the pure white robes, and i knew the light had found my salvation. the next few weeks were agonizing, but everything was worth it. we ate as little as possible, consisting only on meager amounts of rice and beef. we must not weigh down ourselves with food, to be weightless is to weigh as little as you can. we slept as little as possible, only taking one day out of each week to rest. no time could be wasted, and sleep is the biggest waste of time there is. for 24 hours, we spent memorizing the intricate radiant hymns. one day my brother approached me, the voice of radiance with him. he told me that i was now ready to witness the light directly. i nearly broke into tears, the honor was unimaginable, i accepted the privilege wholeheartedly. they lead me to the largest building. i followed them down a long hallway. all the walls were painted pitch black, before i reached the grand chamber of glorious radiance. it was a large circular chamber with walls painted vantablack, with dozens of members all praying, reciting the sacred hymns. in the center, hovering just above the floor, was the glorious radiance itself. i shined like the sun, but shielded one\u2019s eyes from it was forbidden. it emitted a high pitched ringing, which the voice of radiance would interpret into the hymns of radiance. a group of members also came in, restraining another member. he had been conspiring to leave, to tell the authorities what was going on here, of course we could not let him. he was brought directly before the light, the ringing growing louder than before. \u201che is a damn traitor! he was going to abandon us! abandon the glorious light!\u201d they said. the voice of radiance approached, and everyone waited in silence for him to speak the light\u2019s will. \u201cyou commit a grave transgression child, i pity you for being so blind, even after bathing in the light\u2019s glorious radiance. the light has spoken, you must know the light more intimately, to become light, so that you stray not the path again.\u201d the traitor looked up at the light, and it shined brightly on him. but he could not handle the radiance, his skin and eyes began to smoke, and the light burned him. he screamed as the light unleashed its warm and loving wrath upon him. he caught flame, the fire from his body glowing just as bright as the light. he couldn\u2019t scream anymore, and soon he was ashes. the traitor became one with the light, and rejoiced we did. it has been a few weeks since i became one with the glorious radiance, and now my message must be shared. soon the light will encompass all, but i beg the question. will you be embraced, or burn?", "audio": "audios/5.wav", "tokens": ["my younger brother scott had always been the black sheep of the family.", "he was hanging around bad

promise. after i\u2019d gotten done cutting my hay for the day, i went back out to her place and knocked on the door. she invited me in and i asked her how the horse was doing. what she said confused me a little but i didn\u2019t want to pry. she told me he was \u201cback to center\u201d if that rings a bell for any of you guys. i was just happy to hear it was (most likely) doing well. of course, i asked for her permission first but, here\u2019s a little bit about mrs. weller. being a gentleman, i\u2019d never dare to ask a lady her age, but she seems to be no older than 35, and i truly mean this with no disrespect, but that woman is probably the only person i\u2019ve ever met that i could call a hippie.i never knew the circumstances behind her becoming a widow, but through the grapevine i\u2019d heard that she always wore her wedding bands because her husband had passed overseas fighting the good fight, and that was why she\u2019d devoted her life to the \u201cpeace and love\u201d variety. but i wouldn\u2019t take much of that too seriously. the folks that claim to know more than most about her also say this had happened back when the vietnam war was still raging on and i can\u2019t imagine she\u2019s old enough to have been married to someone who\u2019d fought in that war. when i entered her home, i noticed the pleasant flowery smell with an undertone of wood-smoke. a while back i\u2019d heard someone at the gas n\u2019 much ask her what kind of \u201cincense\u201d she uses, referring to how pleasant it smelled on her clothes. whatever that is, i\u2019m assuming it\u2019s where the scent was coming from. she\u2019s a very sweet lady, very long pitch black hair, probably only standing around 5 '2\". she\u2019s always wearing flowy, floor-length skirts and absolutely never wearing shoes. her home is covered floor to ceiling in tapestries and what i can only assume are drawings she\u2019d done herself. again, a kind woman indeed. so, i\u2019ve been thinking about more stories i could tell related to the psa\u2019s. i don\u2019t think i\u2019ve ever been quite as close to the content of the announcements as i was with the whole horse incident, but there is one i remember from way back that definitely stuck with me. i was just a kid, probably only 13 or so. my momma had allowed me to play outside on my own as long as i kept the handheld radio i\u2019d gotten for christmas with me. i was an only child, so playing pretend outside was very common for me. the soft sounds of garth brook\u2019s \u201cif tomorrow never comes\u201d trickled from the speakers. great song, by the way. but, anyway. for whatever reason, no matter how low the volume is, the psa\u2019s are always loud and clear when they come through. i remember it vividly, i was making little plates and silverware with whatever clay i could dig out of the mud hole at the edge of the yard when the announcement tones abruptly cut off brook\u2019s words. \u201cladies and gentlemen, this is a psa for county residents. get inside your home now. get inside your home now. get inside your home now.\u201d the voice was incredibly loud, almost sounding distorted against the soft hum of the cicadas. by that point, i knew to take the broadcasts very seriously, and by the first sentence, i was sprinting back up to the porch. just before i\u2019d reached the steps, my mother opened the slamming door, grabbed my arm and yanked me inside. she turned the deadbolt as soon as the door shut behind me and began dragging me into the kitchen where the trapdoor for the root cellar lay hidden under a rug. i remember the fear in my momma's eyes as she yanked the rug away, lifted the door, and shoved me down so hard i\u2019d completely missed the ladder and fell the 6\u2019 down onto the hard dirt floor at the bottom, radio screaming and warbling in my hand all the while. our root cellar was pretty typical, i think. shelves filled with fruit preserves and canned veggies. momma had stored a couple cases of water and a spare radio down there as well. at the time, i\u2019d figured it was set up that way for the fairly common tornadoes that came through the area. looking back now, i don\u2019t think that\u2019s the kind of disaster she was planning for. momma reached down and shut off my radio, suddenly filling the cellar with an eerie silence. this only lasted for a few seconds, though, before the buzzing started. at first, it was only a small vibration, barely audible through the dirt walls. it was a deep, electrical kind of humming that you can feel in your chest before hearing with your ears. nothing like the humming of mosquitoes or cicadas i was used to in the summer months. i would almost say it was more like a groan, or growl. soon, the noise grew to the point that it was shaking dirt from the walls. momma was sharp as a tack, though. before the settling silt had the chance to fill our little shelter with dust, she\u2019d poured some water on a couple stray tea towels left on the shelves and pressed it against my nose and mouth. god bless that woman, because while i could hardly bear the sound, hands pressed tightly against my ears, she used both hands to hold the rags against our faces while the worst of it passed. it had been hours before the noises had settled. after the worst of it died down a bit, she turned the radio back on and allowed the soothing sounds of george strait and merle haggard to fill the little room we sat in. i didn\u2019t dare bombard my mother with questions at the time, as i could tell she was already very stressed out. it was the first time i\u2019d ever seen an adult show fear and uncertainty. for days we stayed in that cellar, a dull hum providing constant background noise behind the four hour loop of country songs that played on the radio. i could feel the weight of the situation weighing down on me, unsure of how long we\u2019d have to stay there. momma held me nearly the whole time, clearly and heavily burdened by this turn of events. i worried for our goats out by the septic pond, meant to eat the grass around the swampy parts we couldn\u2019t mow without getting the mower stuck. but, after the three days that felt like months, a new broadcast finally came across the radio. \u201cladies and gentlemen, this is a psa for county residents. the storm has passed. it is now safe to leave your homes. god bless.\u201d the announcer almost sounded out of breath, exhausted at least. when we exited the cellar, our home was the same on the inside. i had fixated on the health of our poor goats outside, and as we climbed the ladder out onto the floor of the kitchen, i made my way to the back door, undid the deadbolt and made my way out to their pen. we had five at the time, but i only saw two from afar as i ran towards them. my favorite goat, one i\u2019d named mr. hooves, was still standing as he bleated loudly at me. i pet his rough fur, not yet noticing the grass around them that had turned completely black. not like a fire had come through our land, but like someone had poured black dye onto the blades. i remember hearing murmurs of how the harvest was completely ruined. but the next year, the land provided a bountiful harvest. apparently enough to make up for the lost profits of the year before. the one thing i will never forget, though, as momma drove us through town, was the little mountains of ash that lay on the sidewalk beside the roads, bright white bones protruding from their centers. i couldn\u2019t help but notice the lack of homeless folks around afterwards. scuse\u2019 me folks, i\u2019m starting to hear a scratching noise above me and i\u2019m getting worried the squirrels have found their way back into the attic. i\u2019m sure i\u2019ll be back, but for now i spose i need to grab the broom and get back to my simple little life. previous posts: https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1el2abt/a_psa_from_my_town/", "audio":

memory of its exact hue\u2014stood ominously across from an old cemetery, its crumbling gravestones whispering secrets of the past. the cemetery, overgrown and forlorn, had seen better days, with an abandoned barn nearby, its rotting beams and rusted nails a grim reminder of neglect. the playground at school was just a stone\u2019s throw away, but my brother and i, along with our cousins, found our misguided adventures in the shadows of the graveyard. we weren\u2019t disrespectful\u2014just hood kids from the city, playing tag among the tombstones, our laughter a thin veil over the somber atmosphere. i vividly recall rushing home every night, breathless and sweaty, as the streetlights flickered on, a warning that trouble awaited if i lingered too long, or worse, if i faced an inevitable ass-whoopin. you know, the kind that makes you question your life choices as you scramble for safety. on one particular night, the familiar sound of my parents arguing pierced through the walls of our home, the tension thick enough to cut with a knife. eager to escape the oppressive atmosphere, my brother and i slipped out to the porch. the full moon hung high in the sky, casting an eerie glow over everything, transforming the familiar into something unsettling. i turned to my brother and suggested we venture across the street to the cemetery for a little game of tag. he followed, though he wore a distant look in his eyes, still trapped in the remnants of sleep. as we wandered, the peacefulness of the night was suddenly interrupted by a dark shadow soaring overhead. we exchanged bewildered glances but shrugged it off, thinking it was just a bat. however, a second swoop sent a chill down my spine. by then, we were near the far end of the cemetery, far from the comforting glow of our home. my brother, now visibly frightened, bolted back toward the house, and i, sensing something was amiss but driven by curiosity, trailed behind him. once inside, he muttered he was off to bed, but my adventurous spirit urged me back outside. i tiptoed back to the cemetery, glancing up every few seconds, the adrenaline coursing through my veins. time felt distorted as i wandered around, lost in thought until a loud swoosh echoed, like a giant bird gliding in for a landing. heart pounding, i looked up just in time to see a colossal figure silhouetted against the moonlight. at first, i was confused, remembering a character from a show i used to watch called *the tick*, who had a sidekick with butterfly-like wings. but this creature was no cartoon. the figure was enormous, its wings spreading wide, casting a shadow that engulfed me. as it glided closer, i caught a glimpse of its face\u2014an unsettling, moth-like visage with beady black eyes that seemed to shine with an otherworldly light. fur or hair, a dusty gray, covered its body, and i felt an instinctive dread wash over me. in a panic, i turned and ran, my heart racing as i sprinted back toward the safety of my home. swoosh! the creature swooped again, the sound echoing in the stillness of the night, and i could feel the rush of air as it passed overhead. i reached my front porch, gasping for breath, my mind racing with questions and fear. i stumbled inside and collapsed into bed, trying to convince myself it was just a figment of my imagination. the next day at school, i couldn\u2019t shake the feeling of dread. i told my friend about the encounter, and later that day, a teacher pulled me aside. \"i heard you saw the mothman,\" she said, her expression grave. \"he\u2019s been around since the \u201980s. if you leave him alone, he\u2019ll leave you alone, but if you\u2019ve caught a glimpse, brace yourself for some bad luck.\" i told her what happened, and she just smiled knowingly, adding, \"make sure you stay out of that cemetery from now on.\" \u201chow did she know?\u201d kids being kids, i ignored her warning and returned to the cemetery with my cousins. we were having a great time playing tag until i ran too close to the old barn and stepped directly on a rusty nail, the pain shooting through my heel like a lightning bolt. i was trapped, surrounded by boards with nails sticking out, feeling like the walls were closing in around me. my cousin ever vigilant heard my cries and rushed over, and in a panic, he stepped on the other end of the board, knocking the fear of the night before into me and the rusty nail in my foot out. it was a strange kind of fear, one that both intrigued and terrified me. the kids at school had been buzzing with stories about mothman, but i hadn\u2019t known anything about him until i asked a few friends during lunch. they filled me in on the legend\u2014how he was said to be a harbinger of doom, a creature that appeared before disasters. i listened, wide-eyed, as they recounted tales of sightings in point pleasant, west virginia, just a short drive away. some said he had been spotted near bridges before they collapsed; others claimed he was seen before fires or accidents. i had never been one for ghost stories, but this was different. this was real. i had seen him with my own eyes. as the days passed, i couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that my encounter had somehow marked me. the shadows in the cemetery felt heavier, the rustling of leaves seemed more ominous, and even the playful laughter of my cousins took on an unsettling edge. i became hyper-aware of every creak in the house, every flicker of the streetlights outside. my brother, who used to be my partner in crime, now seemed preoccupied, his demeanor shifting as well. we no longer ventured into the cemetery, and i began to dread the thought of being outside after dark. one evening, as i sat on the porch, watching the sun dip below the horizon, i felt an overwhelming urge to confront my fear. i told myself that i had to go back, to face whatever had terrified me that night. maybe it was a way to reclaim my childhood, to prove that i wasn\u2019t afraid of some myth. so, as the sun set and the shadows grew long, i made up my mind. i slipped out of the house, my heart pounding as i crossed the street to the cemetery. the full moon cast an eerie glow, illuminating the cracked gravestones and overgrown weeds. i felt a mix of dread and determination as i stepped deeper into the graveyard, the cool night air wrapping around me like a shroud. as i wandered, the silence grew deafening. i called out, half-heartedly, \u201cmothman! are you here?\u201d my voice trembled, echoing in the stillness. for a moment, i felt ridiculous, standing there in the dark like a fool. but just as i was about to turn back, i heard it\u2014a low, haunting sound that sent a shiver down my spine. swoosh. i froze. the unmistakable sound of wings slicing through the air. my heart raced as i looked up, and there he was, the creature silhouetted against the moonlight, his massive wings unfurling like a dark omen. the fear that had become a part of me surged back, overwhelming and paralyzing. i could hardly breathe as i stared into those beady black eyes, feeling like a moth drawn to a flame. and then, just as suddenly as he appeared, he vanished into the night, leaving me standing alone in the cemetery, trembling and breathless. the night felt heavier now, the weight of that shadow more pronounced. i turned and ran, my instincts kicking in, propelling me back to the safety of home. when i finally slammed the door shut behind me, i collapsed against it, heart racing. i had faced mothman, and now i understood the true weight of his legend. it wasn\u2019t just about the creature; it was about the fear that lingered long after the encounter, the knowledge that some things in the dark were better left undisturbed. from that night on, i knew i would never play in the cemetery again. the laughter of my childhood had faded into a haunting memory, replaced by the weight of an experience that would stay with me forever. the world felt different now\u2014darker, heavier, and full of shadows that whispered of things best left unseen.", "audio": "audios/7.wav", "tokens": ["twenty-seven years ago, i was just an 11-year-old

boxes. behind them, i discovered a weird hidden doorway! it was locked with a heavy-duty padlock. i tried to pry the fortified enclosure open but it wasn\u2019t about to reveal its secrets. out of frustration, i stuck my ear to the moldy oak panel to listen. i could\u2019ve sworn i heard something on the other side of the child-size opening! after a moment, the feeling passed and i assumed it was only my imagination playing tricks on me. i was curious what was stored inside the tiny locked space so i asked my grandma about it. as soon as the words escaped my curious lips, she gasped audibly, and then scolded me for \u2018snooping\u2019 in places where i wasn\u2019t supposed to be. i was rather startled by her severe, triggered reaction. the level of which, strongly suggested there was much more to the story. ordinarily, grandma was easy going and never uttered a harsh word to anyone. it was a shocking exception to her typical demeanor. further reinforcing the mystery, she warned me it wasn\u2019t \u2018safe\u2019 to be up in the attic because \u2018reoccurring roof leaks had compromised the support joists\u2019. after several unsubtle admonitions to discourage me from ever going back up there again, it was obviously a big deal, which made want to do it that much more. you know how obstinate precocious teenagers can be. as if to reinforce her unusually strict decree, the next time i tried to sneak up the forbidden steps, the staircase itself was barricaded. with all means of giving in to temptation being blocked, i had no choice at the time but to accept things as they were. i assumed the truth was mundane, and that it would be anticlimactic to find out what was actually behind the threshold. at least that\u2019s what i convinced myself, but why would she go to such panicked levels, if that was the case? it made zero sense. either way, i eventually forgot about the diminutive doorway. years went by, and both grandparents passed away. afterward, the house was locked up for the better part of a decade. first my dad maintained it. then he hired a caretaker once it became too much, in his advanced age. as is the way of things for everyone, both my parents grew frail and passed, very close to the same time. i was relieved and thankful that neither of them had to be without the other too long. it was a sobering experience to find myself alone. as the sole heir and inheritor of the shuttered family estate, it became my responsibility to go through it and sell or discard the unwanted contents. property taxes and external upkeep were costing me a fortune, so i made the pragmatic decision to get \u2018the museum\u2019 ready to put on the market, for a retirement nest egg. i hadn\u2019t been to the place in years. hundreds of recollections came flooding back as i walked through it. as a kid, many happy memories were made within those walls and i was tempted to become sentimental and leave it be. deep down though, i knew that would be counterproductive and a waste of the opportunity. it was pointless to put things off any longer. i had to rip off the bandaid and get it done. as if details of the secret door had been deliberately blocked by my subconscious mind until i would have unencumbered access to see it, i was reminded again of the buried memory. i actually sprinted up the steps like a police detective. while the stairs and attic floor creaked a bit, there was no sign of catastrophic damage or risk of collapse, like my grandma warned me about years earlier. to my dismay, the area was even more cluttered and junky, but i wasn\u2019t about to be deterred. i staged the boxes down the hall corridor so i could expose the mystery door again. unbelievably, once the contents were removed, i was faced with an ordinary wall to deny my efforts. there was no sign of the door! for a brief moment, i second guessed myself. had the entire episode been some dream or vivid hallucination? false memories are a well documented phenomenon, but i didn\u2019t want to accept that i\u2019d invented the entire episode. i tapped on the wall in frustration. i even considered that maybe i was mistaken about which wall the door was on. i moved the obstacles away from the other three sides in furious determination. none of them sported the thick, child-sized door i expected to see again. then i realized that the side i remembered having the door, was blocked by a new, false wall added later! i galloped down the steps, two-at-a-time, and out to my work truck. in my toolbox i had a hammer, pry-bar, and all the right equipment to tear down the deceptive facade. in about twenty minutes i had my answer. directly in front of me was the damned oak door again! the bizarre memory; until recently buried and lost, had been officially resurrected and vindicated. still, long after my grandparents and parents had died, i hesitated to put the hammer and chisel to the rusty padlock, to finally answer the burning question of what was on the other side. there was no one left to stop me any longer, but i realized how important it had obviously been to her. grandma must\u2019ve had her reasons to go to such ridiculous lengths to hide it. in honor of respecting her memory and wishes, i weighed all the pros and cons of defying those unknown possibilities. in the end though, you know what i decided to do. it was the same as nearly anyone in my shoes would. i was terrified, but i had to know. the suspense was killing me. the hammer struck the old padlock with a heavy metallic thud. it required three very hard blows to snap open. again, i thought i heard something of significant size scurrying around on the other side of the barrier. my heart heaved. i removed the ruined lock from the hasp loop and tossed it aside, but then hesitated to actually turn the liberated knob, to reveal its dark secrets. my instincts warned me against going any further down the rabbit hole, but my higher logic argued how silly that was. it was my home now to do whatever i wanted. i owned the deed! grandma\u2019s sternly-delivered warnings all those years ago had no bearing on my decisions any longer. i turned the handle. slowly i pulled it toward me. the hinges creaked in protest. exactly as i suspected they would. the fading sunlight from the single attic window in the corner did little to illuminate inside the hidden space. i used my cell phone flashlight to peer into the darkness. there was no pile of human bones or lock boxes with treasure brimming out the top, as my teenage-self imagined. the room was completely empty! my head wanted to explode from the unbelievable, disappointing let down. why go to that effort? i crawled partially inside to confirm what i witnessed with the focused beam of light. my body was half way in the closet-sized area, when i spotted some hastily scrawled writing on the side of one wall. i crept in further to read it. once my body fully passed the threshold, the door slammed shut behind me like a deadening rifle shot. the powerful \u2018thwack!\u2019 absolutely startled me at the time, but i assumed it was merely caused from a cross-ventilation vacuum. that was, until i realized a vacuum would\u2019ve required an opening on the other side, to suck the door closed. i had been too distracted by needing to read the mysterious writing, to focus on being safe. as soon as i had enough time to absorb the bitter irony of crawling fully inside to read the cryptic warning about not doing so, the damage was done. \u201cdo not let the portal to the other side close completely behind you!\u201d; it read in a frantic, hand-lettered scrawl. \u201cyou will be trapped within this chamber of death for two entire days of torment.\u201d i immediately reversed my body in the tight space and slithered back over to turn the knob to escape, but the snare was triggered already. the creepy message in the empty space worked unintentionally as \u2018bait\u2019 to lure me inside. \u2018chamber of death\u2019? my mind raced to decrypt what that might mean. the door itself was not going to budge. that much was clear. i twisted the knob and beat on the wood until my fists were bruised and bloody. i was trapped with absolutely no recourse. whatever the secret room actually was, it did not allow any cell reception to filter through either. i had to hope the written warning was true about it \u2018only\u2019 being a two day lockup for my stupidity. no one knew i was there or would come searching for me. almost immediately i felt like i was no longer trapped in a tiny crawlspace room in my grandparent\u2019s attic. the pitch black room felt immense. i shut off my phone to conserve power. even if i couldn\u2019t call for help, it offered me the possibility of game entertainment and a relative source of timekeeping in the decompression-chamber like stimuli-free environment. thats when everything really started flying off the rails. i saw creepy things hovering nearby in the darkness. fascinating but sinister lights whirled around me and zipped across the so-called \u2018portal\u2019. a discoloration to the ambient fog in the air made the hair on the back of my neck stand on end. then came the charnel stench of dozen rotting slaughterhouses. it was unbearably rank, yet i had no means of escaping it. thats when the dead souls started arriving en-masse. i wasn\u2019t cordoned off or protected from their wrath, and they knew i was still alive! fear doesn\u2019t cover what i went through. nothing could. human words cannot convey the extremities of emotion you experience when you dwell in the same locked space with a procession of \u2018them\u2019. my fingertips bled from clawing the old wood and surrounding walls for a way out. i finally understood my grandma\u2019s unhinged reaction to my younger self discovering the exposed door. what i still didn\u2019t get, was the appeal of having an open portal to hell in the first place. what could possibly entice a person to open that cursed doorway for any reason? i was terrified shitless and couldn\u2019t imagine how it came to be there, or why my grandparents didn\u2019t do a better job of barricading the doorway, prior to when i\u2019d stumbled upon it. neither of them struck me as being involved with the supernatural or the occult blackened arts. regardless, grandma clearly knew what it was but at the moment, it didn\u2019t matter. i was too frightened to worry too much about the origins of the hellhole i found myself trapped inside. i had to survive the next two days first. once my activation triggered the dead to begin showing up, i realized opening the door summoned them to be there. none of them were \u2018happy\u2019 whatsoever about being pawns to the dark forces that controlled the portal, but there were apparently \u2018rules\u2019 they had to follow. no matter how menacing they wanted to be, killing me was thankfully \u2018off limits\u2019. there was no guide book lying around to clarify the parameters, but once i understood they couldn\u2019t physically harm me, it took a great deal of the pressure off. i\u2019m not saying it was a \u2018picnic\u2019 by any stretch of the imagination, but you can even become desensitized to the malevolent mental torture of having untold festering corpses threaten to eat you alive, after a while. i just had to constantly remind myself if they could do any of those nightmarish deeds, they would have done them immediately. it was about the sadism of lingering fear which they craved. soon, it occurred to me why the brave would subject themselves to 48 hours lounging in \u2018hell\u2019s rest stop\u2019. it was because the dead had answers to the mysteries of life and know the future. the tricky part is how to obtain these facts. they wouldn\u2019t simply submit to a \u2018question and answer\u2019 session. i had to get very, very clever. as with the unspoken rule about them not being able harm living participants, i assumed they were also required to be fully truthful if the statements made were phrased perfectly, as in a professional debate. they were so fixated on tormenting me, they didn\u2019t realize i was using them to obtain useful knowledge and information! under those controlled conditions, i decided they had to be honest and forthright. i can\u2019t say there wasn\u2019t collateral damage in this underhanded \u2018quid pro quo\u2019 of mine. they could literally see \u2018the writing on the wall\u2019 and knew it was my very first time trapped in the underworld. dozens of them teased me that they had written the warning message on the wall, but it was just deceitful propaganda. according to them, i was permanently trapped in hell with them! i had no proof the two-day release decree was accurate. i\u2019m not going to lie. crippling doubt crept into my mind and took up residence. the \u2018what ifs?\u2019 were a powerful tool they employed to frighten me, as i kept hearing it over and over in their relentless taunting. finally i was able to overcome the psychological setback after i pointed out that if what they claimed was true, there\u2019d be no reason to scare me about it. i\u2019d live the devastating truth in just 36 more hours. the ferocious gnashing of teeth i witnessed after exposing that lie created a powerful euphoria in me. i\u2019d guess it rivaled a potent narcotic high. they were so furious i applied logic against them; even during the repeated volleys aimed at eroding my hope, that i took immense pleasure in tormenting them right back. thus, i realized why my grandparents caved to the masochistic temptation to put themselves through the ordeal. it is incredibly addictive to fight them and glean their tightly-held secrets about the future of humanity. during that initial excursion, i experienced horrific self-doubt, unrelenting fear, extreme exhaustion, and numerous urges to do things i dare not mention; but i also experienced unparalleled joy. honestly, i never felt more alive than when i thought i might not return. the electrifying experience is that powerful. therein lies the danger. it drags you back to this diabolic door. unfortunately, i must acknowledge some painful truths. i\u2019m documented my deadly mistakes, to prevent others from following the same irreversible path. do not open this literal doorway to hell. please leave it be. it\u2019s of the utmost importance that you recognize the grave error i made by unsealing the lock and traveling \u2018to the other side\u2019. some of the malignant effects of crossing the threshold are obvious. they come almost immediately. a proliferation of festering tumors ravaged my body overnight after the first excursion; and yet i stupidly went back for more! sadly, that\u2019s the ticket for admission for divination secrets. my battered psyche is irrevocably diseased from this madness, as well as my withering flesh. i suspect the toll for any dangerous, reoccurring behavior is cumulative. physical rot and psychological decay will magnify every time you yield to it. for the reader of this testimony, i urge you to believe it and accept the irreparable damage i\u2019ve brought upon myself. learn from my arrogant mistakes. i can\u2019t destroy the door, nor is hiding it isn\u2019t a permanent solution. when the authorities come after my death to settle my personal affairs, they will eventually find it. if you are that unfortunate soul, do not give in to play with supernatural fire i did. my ruin came from innocent curiosity, and then by consuming greed. as they say, money is the root of all evil. any financial windfalls you accumulate from this dangerous game won\u2019t cure the terminal illness that ravages your body and mind afterward, as it does mine now. trust me, some doorways were never meant to be opened.", "audio": "audios/8.wav", "tokens": ["rummaging around in the clutter of my

the names were changed for privacy. the story is the same as best as i could remember it. it was late october, a night when the wind howled through the trees like a restless spirit, and the moon hung low, casting long, eerie shadows over the desolate landscape. i was visiting my grandparents\u2019 ranch in new mexico, nestled deep in the desert, miles from the nearest town. the ranch had always been a place of comfort for me\u2014a place where i could escape the noise of the city and bask in the quiet solitude of the open land. but that night, something felt different, like the land itself was holding its breath, waiting for something to happen. \u201chey, you ever hear those stories about skinwalkers?\u201d my cousin ethan asked, his voice breaking the silence as we sat by the fire pit outside. the flames flickered, casting a warm glow on our faces, but it did little to dispel the growing unease in my gut. \u201cskinwalkers?\u201d i repeated, glancing over at him. his expression was serious, almost too serious for a kid who usually joked about everything. \u201cyeah,\u201d he said, lowering his voice as if the very mention of the word could summon something from the shadows. \u201cthey\u2019re these evil witches or spirits, i\u2019m not really sure. they can shape-shift into animals\u2014wolves, coyotes, whatever. but they\u2019re not just animals, you know? they\u2019re something else, something\u2026wrong.\u201d i chuckled nervously, trying to shake off the creepy feeling creeping up my spine. \u201ccome on, ethan. that\u2019s just some navajo legend, right? something to scare kids?\u201d ethan didn\u2019t laugh. instead, he leaned closer to the fire, his eyes narrowing as he stared into the flames. \u201ci wouldn\u2019t be so sure. my dad said he saw one once, out near the old cattle pens. said it was a coyote, but when he looked into its eyes, he knew it wasn\u2019t just an animal. it was like it was looking into him, reading his thoughts or something.\u201d a shiver ran down my spine despite the warmth of the fire. \u201cwhat happened?\u201d \u201che backed away slowly, got the hell out of there. but he swears it followed him home that night. heard scratching at the windows, like it was trying to get inside.\u201d ethan paused, his voice dropping to a whisper. \u201csaid he heard it whispering his name.\u201d \u201cokay, enough.\u201d i forced a laugh, though my voice wavered. \u201cyou\u2019re just trying to freak me out.\u201d ethan shrugged, a grim smile on his face. \u201cbelieve what you want. just don\u2019t go wandering off alone tonight.\u201d we sat in silence for a while, the wind howling louder as the night grew darker. i couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that we were being watched, that something was out there, just beyond the reach of the firelight. \u201ci\u2019m heading in,\u201d i said finally, standing up and brushing the dirt off my jeans. \u201cit\u2019s getting cold.\u201d ethan nodded, his eyes scanning the darkness beyond the fire. \u201cyeah, good idea. i\u2019ll be right behind you.\u201d as i turned to head back to the house, i heard it\u2014a low, guttural growl, so deep it seemed to vibrate through the ground beneath my feet. i froze, my heart pounding in my chest. \u201cdid you hear that?\u201d i whispered, my voice barely audible. ethan was already on his feet, his eyes wide with fear. \u201cdon\u2019t move,\u201d he hissed. \u201cwhatever you do, don\u2019t run.\u201d the growl came again, closer this time. slowly, i turned my head, my breath catching in my throat as i saw it\u2014a pair of glowing eyes in the darkness, fixed on us with an intensity that sent a wave of pure terror through my body. the creature was massive, hunched over on all fours like a wolf, but there was something horribly wrong with it. its limbs were too long, too distorted, and its fur was matted and filthy, almost like it was rotting away. and those eyes\u2014they weren\u2019t the eyes of an animal. they were filled with malice, with a sick, twisted intelligence that made my blood run cold. \u201cget to the house, now,\u201d ethan whispered, his voice shaking. we backed away slowly, never taking our eyes off the creature. it didn\u2019t move, just watched us, its growl rumbling through the night air like a warning. my heart raced as we reached the edge of the firelight, the safety of the house still too far away. and then, with a sudden, terrifying speed, the creature lunged forward. \u201crun!\u201d ethan shouted, grabbing my arm and yanking me toward the house. we sprinted across the yard, the sound of the creature\u2019s heavy breathing right behind us. i could hear its claws scraping against the ground, its growl turning into a savage snarl as it closed the distance between us. my legs burned, my lungs screamed for air, but i didn\u2019t dare slow down. the porch light was in sight, the old wooden steps just a few feet away. ethan reached them first, throwing himself up the stairs and bursting through the door. i was right behind him, my hand outstretched, but just as i reached the steps, something sharp sliced across my ankle, sending me crashing to the ground. \u201cget up!\u201d ethan screamed from the doorway, but the pain was too intense. i looked back, and my heart stopped. the creature was right there, towering over me, its breath hot and rancid on my face. \u201cplease\u2026\u201d i whispered, barely able to speak. the creature tilted its head, almost as if it were curious, its glowing eyes narrowing. and then, to my horror, it began to change. its fur receded, its limbs twisted and cracked, contorting into a grotesque parody of a human form. within moments, it was standing upright, a tall, gaunt figure with skin so pale it seemed to glow in the dark. its face was a nightmare\u2014a twisted, elongated snout with sharp, jagged teeth, and those eyes, those terrible, glowing eyes that now looked disturbingly human. it leaned down, its face inches from mine, and i heard it speak in a low, rasping voice that made my skin crawl. \u201cyou shouldn\u2019t have come here,\u201d it whispered, its breath like ice against my skin. with a surge of adrenaline, i kicked out with my good leg, catching it off guard. it stumbled back, and i scrambled to my feet, half-crawling, half-running up the steps. ethan grabbed me, pulling me inside just as the creature lunged again, its claws raking across the door as we slammed it shut. we collapsed on the floor, gasping for breath, our hearts pounding in our chests. the creature howled in rage, the sound echoing through the house, rattling the windows. we could hear it circling outside, its heavy footsteps crunching on the gravel as it stalked around the house, looking for a way in. \u201cwe need to call someone,\u201d i gasped, my voice trembling. \u201cthe police, anyone.\u201d \u201cwho\u2019s gonna believe us?\u201d ethan said, his voice just as shaky. \u201cthey\u2019ll think we\u2019re crazy.\u201d we huddled together in the middle of the room, every creak of the floorboards, every rustle of the wind outside sending a fresh wave of fear through us. the creature\u2019s howls grew fainter, then stopped altogether. but we knew it was still out there, waiting, watching. \u201cwe can\u2019t stay here,\u201d i whispered, my voice barely audible. \u201cit\u2019ll get in eventually.\u201d ethan nodded, but neither of us moved. we were too terrified, too paralyzed by the thought of what was waiting for us outside. hours passed, though it felt like days, and the night dragged on in suffocating silence. finally, as the first light of dawn began to creep through the windows, we heard it\u2014the soft padding of footsteps moving away from the house, disappearing into the distance. we waited until the sun was fully up, until the warmth of daylight filled the room, before we dared to move. slowly, cautiously, we opened the door and stepped outside. the yard was empty, the only sign of what had happened the deep gouges in the ground where the creature had stood. but i knew it wasn\u2019t over. the memory of those glowing eyes, that voice whispering in the dark, would haunt me forever. we never spoke of that night again, not to each other, not to anyone. but from that day on, i never went near the ranch at night, and i always kept a wary eye on the shadows, knowing that somewhere out there, the skinwalker was waiting. and it knew my name.", "audio": "audios/9.wav", "tokens": ["edit: the names were changed for privacy.", "the

at 4pm/16:00. i don't work mondays to wednesdays and typically spend that time doing chores as i don't want to do it on working days due to either feeling stressed that i have to get ready for work or the fear that i will leave a task unfinished. however, i'm turning 25 soon and it's a big deal for me. i live in a small apartment and have for the last days done a full proper cleaning of everything, reorganizing everything and fully renovating my apartment as much as legally possible in my renting contract. today is thursday, i start work at 4. despite avoiding doing chores on working days, i figured if i get up early enough i can do the last thing on my long list which is laundry. the apartment i live in is so small that i don't have space for a washing machine. i have one designated to me in the basement, but it's old and hasn't been working for a couple of months (landlord won't fix it). that's fine as i go to a laundromat that's a 15 minute walk from where i live and the laundromat has dryers as well which allows me to dry my clothes without hanging it in my limited space apartment. well, i regret that as everything that could go wrong at a laundromat, did go wrong at the laundromat. it typically takes ca 2 hours for a wash and dryer. i arrived at 10 am and figured it would be more than enough time to finish laundry. the laundromat is small, only 8 washers and 8 dryers available, but it tend to be slow during daytime as most people have work or school. when i got there a camping van was parked outside and an italian family of 10 were using all the machines at once to wash their clothes. in addition to that a couple of others were waiting in line. i figured fuck it, i got nowhere else to be and decided to wait. it took 2 hours to get a washing machine! i also had underestimated how much laundry i was bringing and thus had to use two machines. because i didn't want to be a dick i let the people behind me get machines before i used my second one, hence why it took 2 hours to get all my clothes in. alright, 4 hours before work, cutting it close, but manageable. 1 hour later and both my machines are finished. now i just need a couple dryers. however, the italian family was still there. in addition to that some restaurant nearby was washing all of their uniforms. all the dryers were occupied. a new competitor had entered. i have 3 hours before work. let the battle of the dryers begin! the italians snatch the first 2 dryers that become available. 10 minutes had passed, but the next dryer will be available in just 18 minutes. there are no laundry baskets at the laundromat, which there typically are and since my laundry was still in the machine i was taking up space. i rush to the grocery store to buy a large eco friendly bag to put some of my laundry in and when i come back the italians were already holding the door. apparently, the customer decided to finish the dryer early while i was gone. they were not filling the dryer though, just chatting. i wait patiently for another 10 minutes before i politely ask if they're going to use the dryer and if i could take it. they shooed me away. well, at least they loaded up the dryer immediately after so we got a move on. next dryer, just 5 minutes away from finishing. both me and the italians are staring at it, western standoff style. it finishes and now we just need to wait for the user to pick up the laundry. 15 minutes pass, nothing. now at this point you could just load the laundry in a basket, but there is none there and they were washing all whites so placing it at the countertop would be disrespectful. i figure i can have a cigarette while waiting outside and if anyone comes in i'll stump it out and go back on duty. i finish my cigarette, nobody went inside. unfortunately, the dryer had been snatched by the restaurant while i was outside. turns out the lady that used the dryer was inside the whole time, but forgot about it as she was on her phone. i thought she was waiting for a washing machine, my bad. next dryer, 10 minutes from completion. downside, it was in between two of the italian dryers and they were waiting patiently. i sit right next

had gone back to the restaurant so she was not present. i head outside to look around for her, she's no where. as i go in, the italians had emptied the dryer and was loading their clothes. no fucking shot! i didn't want to do this, but i channelled all the karens i've faced after working in the service industry and went ballistic on them. \"you already have 3 active dryers! i've been here for hours! i've got work soon! you obviously have nowhere to be! no it's not a policy written anywhere, but it's common fucking decensy to not use all the damn dryers at once when there's a fucking line\"! however, while i was arguing, one of the italians paid for the machine and started it. alas, i had been outsmarted. i finally get a dryer 20 minutes later. problem is, i was using 2 washing machines and since it had taken me this long i couldn't wait for 2 dryers. there was also a line behind me so even if i did have the time i would just stoop down to the lows of my enemy. i squeezed in all of my laundry into the dryer so i only had to use one. another problem, my laundry had been sitting in a bag for so long that it was soaking wet. that and it being filled so tight meant that the 1 hour it normally takes, bumped up to over 2 hours once i started the machine. fuck... me... i had less than 1:30 before i had to be at work. i figured i'll head home and shower and do other preparations while it's in the dryer. i might not be able to finish the cycle completely, but i had hope. after doing everything at home, i noticed i had no clean t-shirts as they were all being washed. only thing i had that was clean was a dumb shirt i inherited from my dad. no worries, i'll wear a jacket over it and i'll be changing to my uniform when i get to work regardless. let's fold it up; i got back to the laundromat and had to end the cycle early as it didn't finish in time. my suitcase was stolen as i had left it there, my mistake. i had to carry my mostly wet laundry in defeat by hand the way home, the bag wasn't much help. it wasn't without casualties. my infamous spider-man sheets had been dropped on the way and needed to be recleaned, but worst of all i had lost my uniform. on the way back or forgotten in the dryer, i do not know. no worries i guess, i should have a spare uniform hanging at work. it took some time to arrange space to hang up my remaining laundry

seemed to be perfect to me. we liked the same things. she said all the right things. we had so much fun together. she put as much effort into the dates as i did. the sex life was amazing. when i decided to date again, i knew i was looking for the one. i'm at that stage in my life where i don't want to date around or sleep around anymore. i was very honest about who i am, and what i am looking for. i felt so comfortable with her. i opened up to her. i shared things with her i've never told anyone else. i recognized some red flags very early on. she lacked communication via text. she always said she just forgot, or just fell asleep, or was busy. i asked her about it nicely a couple times, and found out she was taking dating advice from tiktok and this is something she learned to make me want her more. she admitted to doing it intentionally but would change. this problem continued almost the entire relationship. i should have ran away here, i didn't. she had many (mostly) guy friends around her age, her other friends were a mix of immature 20 somethings from work. she said it's due to her hobbies, girls don't like video games or cars. i was ok with this, as long as she did not have any sexual history with any of them. i set a hard boundary for this. she admitted to dating one in high school, but it was so long ago there was nothing between them anymore. i was ok with him after meeting him and she swore up and down there was no sexual history with any others. i later found she and him would send porn, hentai and other suggestive content to each other, which led to me finding out more. i also noticed she would text and call this \"friend\" far more often and frequent than she would text or call me. a guy she used to casually hook up with hit her up and said how much he missed her and thought she was really cool. i asked her to block him, she didn't understand why but did anyways (or so she told me) i never verified this. she refused to admit that he was likely hitting her up to hook up. she said he was just being friendly. i told her i don't care either way, it's a hard boundary for me to not be in contact with previous hook ups or exes, if she does that then i don't want to be in a relationship. she said i was being controlling and insecure but would abide by that boundary anyways. i should have ran here, i didn't. she had an out of town friend that she goes to shows with, she swore many times that she's never slept with him. i had multiple conversations with her how i could tell that this dude was into her, and wanted to sleep with her. he would pressure her to take ecstacy with him. he had taken advantage of her friend. he was hooking up with a married woman. this guy was bad news and i knew it. she wanted to go out with him one night and i said i would trust her, just to text me when she got home. she never did. she swore to me that she just got too drunk and forgot. she invited me to the show they had planned with him and her the very next day, and he was clearly upset that i was there, and they had a blow up fight and he went home. after i saw the inappropriate content with her other \"friend\" i looked in her dms (with her permission) and found out that she actually did have a sexual history with this person, and she lied to me about it. multiple times. i still don't believe that she didn't sleep with him that night she got too drunk and \"forgot\" to text me back. i broke up with her immediately upon finding this out, as i had also set a hard boundary about being honest/not lying to me. i probably could have found much more info, but what's the point? i had all i needed to know to break up. there were plenty more red flags. i found condoms in her backpack. she was so secretive with her phone. she would get texts from unsaved numbers and say i was just imagining it, nothing was there and she \"never deletes anything\". i was gaslit into believing her for 8 months and it made me feel horrible. i talked to my therapist constantly about this, she suggested i trust her as that's all i could do. i considered medication thinking i must be crazy. she promised me so many times she would never lie to me, she would never do anything to hurt me, she didn't want to ruin this relationship, she loved me so much. she was supposed to move in in 3 weeks. we had future plans together. i feel relief being out of this relationship, it was pure torture mentally. i had never had trust issues in any previous relationship until this one. at the same time i just wish i could talk to her again, and work things out, but i know the trust is completely gone. it's an awful feeling. i wouldn't wish this on anyone. i suppose i dodged a bullet but right now i feel like shit. tl;dr tifu by ignoring the red flags in my

advice from someone not connected to me or my husband. my husband (i'll call him josh) and i have been together for 6 years, married for 4, and we don't have kids. we have a really healthy and communicative relationship, we're both pretty easy-going and i really love him. he started working at a large accounting firm about 3 years ago, and from what he tells me he loves it there. he's made a lot of friends through his job and he goes out with them for drinks and social events quite often, and i've been totally okay with that. i'm quite introverted so i've never been interested in meeting his colleagues or work friends, nor have i asked to. i've got my own circle of friends and i'm fine with us having separate friend groups. after what happened yesterday it only just occurred to me that he has never actually asked me if i'd like to meet any of them, or go to one of his work events, i guess that's important context. anyway, i'll start with what happened a few months ago, that i had brushed off until now. i was at a bar with some friends for a couple of friday after-work drinks, and a guy approached me (he was there with some friends, too). he looked slightly familiar but i hadn't met him before. he seemed friendly enough, and he asked me, \"[my name], right?\" i think i must have just given him a confused look, because he followed up with, \"i'm jake, i work with josh.\" i realised that i recognised him from some photos on my husband's phone (i don't use social media except for a private instagram, so i'm not sure if he posted the photos anywhere but we've got a very trusting relationship so i look in his photos sometimes don't hate me). this is where it gets a bit embarrassing. i'm a bit socially awkward and so i struggled to end the conversation, but he just kept talking at me, i guess he was already a couple of beers deep. but while he was talking, he said something like, \"it's great that you guys are still so close. i haven't talked to my brother in ages.\" at the time i was like, huh? but i just assumed he was drunk and not making sense, so i ignored it. he started to get a little flirty so i turned to my friends and we left shortly after that. i didn't say anything to them about it and it didn't seem like a big deal to me. i also decided not to tell my husband that i had met his coworker jake. not to hide it, but because i figured the guy wouldn't even remember talking to me, and i didn't want to make it awkward for josh at work by telling him his colleague tried to hit on me. i just thought no harm no foul. but, yesterday morning, i was out walking our dog, monty (he's a cross between a few breeds and has very unique markings this matters i promise) and was on my way to my regular cafe, which is in town. i was waiting in line to order, and the guy in front was an older man. he got his coffee and turned around, but stopped and looked at my dog and goes, \"hello monty!!!\" monty was super excited to see him, apparently, and so i guessed that the guy was another colleague of josh's, because josh brings the dog to the office a couple of times a week. i thought it was sweet, to be honest, so i smiled at him and said hi. he introduced himself (i guessed correctly that he was a colleague), but then he said something like, \"aren't you a good sister, walking his dog for him!\" i was so confused that i didn't even know how to react at first, so i stumbled on my words and just said \"it's my dog.\" i regret it but i genuinely couldn't bring myself to correct him and say that i'm josh's wife and not his sister. it was just too awkward, and i just wanted to leave because i think was suddenly dawning on me what might have been going on. he asked me something about \"sharing a dog\" but i was able to escape the conversation by being next in line to order my coffee, and he left. i seriously don't know what to do, because what the fuck????? do i even ask my husband about this? part of me is just assuming or hoping that it's a mistake, that he doesn't talk about me much at work and they assume we are related because we both have brown hair but the thought that he has been telling his coworkers that i'm his sister (and evidently they have seen what i look like, so they must have seen photos) makes my stomach churn. i don't even know how i would broach the subject with him. i need some help what would you guys do in this situation? i have only told one friend what happened because it's so weird and embarrassing, and she has jumped straight to \"time to plot his downfall\" (because she's my ride-or-die, love her), but i don't want to immediately assume the worst or ruin my marriage over something that could be nothing. i'm sorry for the long and rambly post, but i would really appreciate any and all advice!! edit: holy fuck, thank you everyone who commented with some advice! i haven\u2019t read all of them but i really appreciate the suggestions from you guys. a small update, josh came home at about 2:30am last night, but he was drunk so he just went straight to sleep, which is fine by me because fuck having this conversation in that state. i\u2019ve just woken up but he\u2019s still sleeping. first thing i just want to clear up i\u2019ve seen a lot of people suggesting i have crippling social anxiety, or am severely introverted, which i suppose you could glean from the way

weekends consist of unending sports bar beers, where i assume i would be mansplained everything until my ears bleed (prob a negative assumption, but i\u2019m sure some of you know what i mean). i suppose you could say that i\u2019m \u201cconfrontation averse\u201d in that i\u2019m quite laid back and prefer to keep a conversation easy and positive, idk. i don\u2019t like it when things are awkward and correcting when people misrecognise me is one of those things, but i\u2019m not terrified of confrontation. also, my husband and i do share some mutual friends, i didn\u2019t explain that well but our lives are not entirely separate. the way he acts towards me around our mutual friends is extremely affectionate and normal. it is only his \u201cwork friends\u201d that i have never interacted with. i\u2019ve also seen some people suggest that what is going on is equivalent to my husband beating me and me hopelessly wondering whether i should break up with him. or that i\u2019m stupid for thinking my relationship was healthy when it \u201cclearly isn\u2019t\u201d. like, damn, cut me some slack! i\u2019m a real person and this is an entirely alien and bizarre situation for me. my first reaction wasn\u2019t to assume the worst but i do appreciate that you all have made me certain that it is a big deal. i guess i needed confirmation that the things that happened are enough \u201cproof\u201d that josh has been purposefully lying, and they weren\u2019t just mixups. i\u2019m going to talk to him today, and ask him directly why he\u2019s telling his coworkers that i\u2019m his sister. i followed the advice of writing my points down so that they don\u2019t get lost if i get emotional, lol. i will do my best not to let him slither out of it and i hope he has some proof that his colleagues know i\u2019m his wife. i know that\u2019s not the theatrical confrontation you guys were hoping for, but it\u2019s a saturday, and i can\u2019t wait! wish me luck, thank you

25. she is stunning and i was jealous to be honest. but he said he needed a very beautiful girl to attract donors and convince people to donate. soon, the jealousy stopped from my side and more i pitied the girl because she was never good enough for what he wanted of her. in my opinion she did her job well. but he even cut her money with 20% when she was late. and he spoke badly of her to me, saying she deserves to be this poor because she is stupid and has zero life skills. he treats all his people this way, not just her so i doubt he was trying to hide an affair. all of his employees or most of them, male or female, don't stay for more than 6 months because he is basically a jerk who think of himself as being a god. yet everyone seems to love him in the beginning because he is charming and he is confident and i can understand why people, especially women think he is great (in the beginning). but he got this woman pregnant. i will divorce, of course, i am not here because i don't know what to do regarding this. i will leave. but i just need to talk to someone. to understand what happened. i feel guilty and i feel angry. guilty because when this girl wanted to leave too,

contact her, but i did. and she told me she thinks she developed feelings for him, but she will stay away from our marriage, she promised me this and begged me to forgive her. i wanted to reply but she blocked me. i confronted him about all this. he is calm, as usual. it seems nothing touched him. he even said he is sure the kid is not his because she is sleeping around like the little slt she

start by saying that my parents had my sister, jenna, on accident, when i was 14, so i never really had a very close relationship with her until a few months ago as i moved out for college when she was four. to keep a long story short, jenna found out she was pregnant a few months ago during her senior year, and my parents immediately kicked her out. i have been no contact with my parents for roughly eight years now and hadn't seen my sister since she was about 11. apparently after she was kicked out, she stayed at a friend's place on her couch for a few weeks before deciding to call me via instagram. i was shocked to see the notification, but answered anyways. we ended up talking for over an hour as she cried and told me everything that happened. she was pregnant, had no family except me, and she's just a teenager. it broke my heart, and the next day we met up for the first time in years. seeing how much she'd changed since the last time i saw her broke my heart. because of my parents, and an issue that happened with them that i won't get into here, i missed getting to see my baby sister grow up. jenna told me about her situation and how she wasn't going to be able to go to college (even though she had amazing grades, and had been accepted to multiple schools) because of the baby and the fact that she needs to work to support him. she told me about how she was staying on a couch, and the whole situation made me frustrated. that night when i got home i was telling my husband about it and i brought up the idea of her staying in our guest house. for a little bit of context, me and my husband are very well off as we both worked high paying jobs. we have two daughters aged 5 and 6, and after my youngest was born we came to the mutual agreement that he would be a sahd and i would continue to work as my salary was over double what his was. even with him at home, we have enough to afford a large house, and a guest house in the backyard (which i am extremely grateful for) when i brought up the idea to him, he immediately said no. he didn't want jenna and her baby in the house as he thought it would add extra stress. after a bit of a back and forth, and maybe me guilting him a bit, he reluctantly agreed, and she moved in. after she came to live with us, jenna and i became way closer. i was at her high school graduation, i was the one who convinced her to go to the college a few minutes from our house, i was the only one in the room when she gave birth, and i was the second person to ever get to hold my nephew, daniel. we set up a crib next to her bed in the guest house and i thought the problem was solved. everything seemed okay until a couple of weeks ago when jenna started her new college classes. my husband hadn't complained much until then because he never had to be around her or the baby much. jenna got a job after he was born bartending so her shift didn't start until mine was over, and i could watch daniel while she was gone. however, now her morning classes conflict with my work schedule, meaning my husband has to watch daniel sometimes. this year our youngest started kindergarten, meaning he has a lot of free time. he still cleans the house and does grocery runs, but he also has hours and hours of free time during the day. he got pissed off that he had to watch the baby, even though it's just for 3-4 hours in the mornings, and basically yelled at me one night saying \"i shouldn't have to suffer just because your freeloading sister made a stupid decision and got pregnant\" and went off on a rant about the extra money we have to spend. i tried to stay calm and reminded him that she's still just 18, and frankly she works harder than he does. it would be a different situation if we couldn't afford it, and she wasn't showing any initiative, but that isn't the case. she takes college classes, works six nights a week, and still is a great mom to her son. she has shown us nothing but gratitude and even found time in her schedule to make my husband a cake for his birthday. kicking her out and making her fend for herself would be stupid. she wouldn't be able to stay in school, she'd be barely scraping by to pay rent in some shitty apartment, and she would be stuck barely staying afloat for her son's whole childhood. it may cost us a bit more time and money now, but when she gets her degree, finds a stable job, and can move to a decent place where she doesn't have to worry about getting her son his next meal, it will have been a small sacrifice. he couldn't see that though and kept on arguing about the money and the time he has to spend taking care of a baby that isn't his. i went off and said something along the lines of \"she's my sister, and it's my money. i'll spend it how i want, and if you're gonna be too much of a child to help out for a few hours a day then i'll just use said money to hire a nanny who might actually care about my family.\" he was stunned as i'm never one to raise my voice and generally try to avoid conflict. then he made a big stink about how i don't appreciate him, and if i cared about the life we've built together that i wouldn't be sacrificing it for some teenage girl i barely know. now we're both mad, and for the last couple of days neither one of us have spoken to each other very much unless we have to. i've been dropping off daniel at my friend, ashley's house on my way to work, and jenna has been picking him up after her classes because my husband refuses to watch him. how can i fix the situation and change my husband's mind? kicking jenna out isn't something i'm willing to do. tl;dr: my husband is mad that i let my teenage sister and her son come live with us as he doesn't want to spend the extra money or help take care of the baby. how do i convince him this is the right choice? edit to respond to the most common concerns: i agree what i said about the money was out of line and i will apologize to him for that. it\u2019s his money as much as mine. those of you saying it\u2019s my sister\u2019s own fault she got pregnant and didn\u2019t get an abortion should not speak on things you don\u2019t know about. unless you were there the night she got pregnant, don\u2019t assume it was her fault at all, i don\u2019t think she exactly gave consent. and we live in a state where getting an abortion was not an option especially as late in her pregnancy as she was when she found out. my main problem was the fact that he seemed unwilling to meet in the middle. he doesn\u2019t have a job and spends most of his time just lounging while the girls are at school. he doesn\u2019t wanna help with the baby, or go back to work, or get a nanny, and i was frustrated he didn\u2019t seem to be willing to compromise on any of these things. when i said i guilted him into agreeing, that was a poor choice of words. i just explained to him that she had nowhere else to go and if we didn\u2019t help, i was worried she and her son may be put in an unsafe situation. i\u2019m going to try to make time to talk to both of them later about the situation and i\u2019ll make sure that i take both of their feelings into consideration as things obviously can\u2019t stay the way they are now. i appreciate the feedback, as harsh as it was to hear, and accept that i\u2019m the one in the wrong here. i\u2019ll try to stop

describe their moody teenagers. she goes out of her way to do absolutely cruel stuff to me. she calls me a bitch all the time, and many other horrible words. she belittles every single thing i do and makes fun of my appearance all the time. she also \u201cpranks\u201d me. pranks in quotations because they are not funny in any way at all, just plain cruel. the situation: while we were on vacation

my appearance one by one, which hurt me a lot. i told her that that was a very rude thing to say but she just responded by laughing and called me a \u201csensitive bitch\u201d. ever since we\u2019ve

booked multiple botox appointments at many different clinics, and liposuction. after booking she messages me the information and tells me to attend the appointment. i have no interest in getting any kind of plastic surgery but she pressures me to a whole new level. every time i miss an appointment that she booked, she calls me no matter what time it is and where i am and screams at me on the

we were speaking kind of loudly because next thing i know a woman is tapping me on the shoulder and handing me a business card. she said, \"i am a teen counselor, please don't hesitate to give me a call.\" i immediately said back, \"well we are both in our 20's so we won't be needing that\" and handed the card back to her. she looked so taken aback by my comment and just kind of froze next to us. i ushered my sister away and just tried to forget it. well, when we were checking out, the woman was in the lane next to us and she was giving me and my sister a noticeable side eye. then, an older man standing behind us in line leaned over to her and apologized for my \"behavior\" because i guess he'd witnessed our interaction. he said he'd \"never get used to how rude the younger generation is\", and then he leaned closer to me and my sister and said \"that woman was just trying to be courteous to you, there was no reason to be so dismissive to a kind stranger\". i literally had no idea what to say, my sister didn't either. i just turned completely away from him and thankfully was able to use checking out the groceries as an excuse to move on from the interaction. on the way back to my grandpa, my sister and i just kind of laughed at how weird it was but for some reason i can't stop thinking about it. imo, the woman way overstepped when she offered us her card. she didn't know us or what we were dealing with at all. when my sister and i left the store we could feel the two of them staring at us, it was so uncomfortable and weird. am i the asshole? for being rude? would you have taken her card? edit: thanks everyone for all of the comments and well wishes for my grandpa. i am a chronic overthinker and this situation has just been sitting unpleasantly with me, especially because this last week has been high stress and anxiety. my sister and i are 20 and 22, and it wasn't necessarily the fact that the woman assumed we were teenagers that threw me off i think it was just her very direct approach. my sister started to cry and i put my arm around her and was just talking to her and was really just startled when the woman approached from behind. we were not trying to cause a scene, i had just assumed we were louder than we thought since we had caught her attention. we were in public but i was trying to make it more of a private moment for my sister. i wasn't trying to be rude to her just direct, since she didn't say anything else to either of us before or after and i was a bit confused and put off. we were in the store for 10-15 more minutes without seeing her before we went to check out and the woman was at first openly staring at both of us, but when i made eye contact she looked away and continue to look at us both as we moved forward in line, then with the man's comments on top of that i kept thinking wow i must've really missed something about this interaction because i would not have given it another thought if not how they behaved in the line. i didn't look at her card before handing it back so i have no idea where she worked or if she was religiously affiliated or not. the man was genuinely creepy, he got way too close to talk to us and i don't feel bad for not engaging with him, honestly. my family is staying in town through the weekend to be with my grandpa and i am going to try not to think about it anymore. even

careful.\u201d so from then on, every morning i\u2019d wake up and my only motivation to go to work was because work was my new drug dealer. otherwise, i wouldn\u2019t have bothered to even show up at all. i\u2019d wear long sleeve shirts under my scrubs and once i got report i would get my supplies and head to the bathroom to get my iv in place for my shift. this was my daily ritual and became almost an unconscious act. it was just part of my work routine and i kept telling myself \u201ci have to do this because if i don\u2019t i will be so sick that i\u2019ll be useless to anyone\u201d. so the lies, stealing, and drug use continued. i eventually changed my schedule to 7p-7a so there were less management, less doctors, and less nurses to ensure my secret would stay hidden. as you can imagine, the months went by and i started having more and more unusual behavior that people were taking note of. i\u2019d always need to use the restroom, i\u2019d always have an excuse to \u201crun out to my car\u201d so i could smoke a cigarette and pick a hospital bathroom along the way to inject the dilaudid. on several occasions, in my narcotic haze, id fall asleep outside while on my lunch break. this was explained away several times by blaming it on my inability to adapt to the night shift hours. this entire time i truly felt i was functioning at a normal level and thought nothing of quitting. it never was even an option for me because of the shock wave that would ripple through my life if anyone found out. no one knew, not my family, not my fiance, not anyone, and i wanted to keep it that way. so my train continued roaring down the tracks at an alarming pace until it inevitably derailed completely. my last day of work started like any other. only this time i had a very specific agenda. i arranged my schedule so that i\u2019d have five days off, which also meant five days with no access to what had become my sole source of drugs. so my plan was to sign out my normal amount of narcotics but stash away half of them to use over the next five days while i was off. as my shift came to an end, i gave report to the nurse relieving me, feeling comforted by the fact that i had 7 vials of dilaudid in my scrub pocket for my upcoming days off. as i was walking out of the unit, my nurse manager was walking toward me and asked if i could take a few minutes and head down with her to hr to discuss a code i was involved in the previous week. an older woman went into cardiac arrest in a different part of the hospital and as a part of the \u201ccode team\u201d, i went to help. i took turns with another rn doing cpr and pushing cardiac meds to attempt to save her. she didn\u2019t make it and my nurse manager told me i forgot to chart something about the code. the possibility never crossed my mind that i was about to be confronted about my drug use, but it should have. the only unusual thing i kind of noticed was my manager instructed me to leave my coat and purse in my locker. i thought to myself \u201cwhy wouldnt i be bringing my stuff with me if i\u2019m on my way out after i quickly explain this code?\u201d i shrugged this off and followed her down to the bottom floor of the hospital. we approached the conference room, she opened the door and i immediately realized that this was not about the code. i walked in the room and was met by the head of pharmacy, the district attorney for the county, the head of mental health, and of course next to me was my manager. i sat down and the pharmacist started showing me my narcotics charting over the last year or so. i already knew where this was going but i didn\u2019t know where it would end. each person spoke at length about my suspicious charting. i wish i could tell you what was said, but i can\u2019t. i sat there watching their mouths move but their voices were muted. all i could hear was the sound of my heart pounding in my ears. i was picturing my mom and dad\u2019s face when they found out i was in jail for stealing drugs from the hospital. i pictured calling my fianc\u00e9 to tell him i was a complete fraud. i wasn\u2019t the intelligent, successful, ambitious woman i had portrayed myself to be. i was a broken, lying, stealing, drug addict who was about to lose everything. i was a shell of the person i have been pretending to be. once i brought myself back to the reality of what was happening in the conference room, my first thought was to deny everything. how could they prove any of this? my second thought was, i\u2019d been working so hard to hide this deep dark secret and i\u2019m exhausted. so i took a deep breath, mustered any speck of honesty i had still clinging to a dusty corner of my soul, and told the district attorney everything. i was surprised at how relieved i felt that someone else knew my secret, even if that meant i was now in some serious trouble. i didn\u2019t tell him about the 7 vials of dilaudid in my pocket because why did it matter? i just told him what i did and besides, i\u2019d definitely need 1 or 2 of those when i left. i\u2019d be damned if i\u2019d just willingly give them up. if i ever needed something to numb my pain, it was now. just as i finalized my decision to keep the 7 vials to myself and not mention it, he told me he needed to search me. appalled, i refused the search and asked to leave immediately. he explained to me that they needed to make sure i didn\u2019t have any hospital owned property and i couldn\u2019t leave without being searched. i felt defeated in every sense of the word and slowly emptied the contents of my scrub pockets onto the conference table. he took the tourniquet, syringes, and vials of dilaudid and patted me down to make sure that was all i had. at this point, i thought for sure that i was about to be handcuffed and taken to jail. to my complete surprise, he looked at me and said \u201ci hope you get the help you need, here is the number to the nurse peer assistance program. call it as soon as you get home and check into a rehab asap. i\u2019ll be in touch.\u201d two hospital security guards then walked me up to my locker, searched my coat and purse, and then

i opened the double door, some other kid opened a bathroom door and they smashed together. i don\u2019t even understand how but his finger managed to get caught in between, which we didn\u2019t even notice at first. i just said sorry and started chatting to him (he wasn\u2019t a close friend but we had a few small convos here and there) until he looked down at his hand with a slightly concerned look on his face. it was just blood and i didn\u2019t know what to do. i assumed it was just a really bad cut. luckily, stars aligned and the school nurse was coming round the corner at this moment, although i don\u2019t think a wet paper towel was gonna fix this one. at the same time we all just see the top of a finger on the floor and realise what had happened. but i wasn\u2019t allowed to stay there long and was shooed back to my class by the nurse. i got scalded by my teacher for 1. leaving and 2. coming back. the only words that came out of my mouth was \u201ci just cut l******s finger off\u201d. nobody really believed me i guess and we moved on. then he didn\u2019t come in for a while and it was becoming the talk of the school. after a while, a picture of his finger circulated around school, it was black after the doctors had sown it back on i guess?? i don\u2019t think he ever got the function back on that finger and ive felt bad about it since. i\u2019ve left secondary now but somehow it still comes back to haunt me and by a few select people i am know as \u201cthat girl who cut that kids finger off\u201d. i\u2019ve also heard a lot of rumors about the situation and

"51": {"post": "twenty years ago when i was 18, and immediately following my father's divorce and suicide, my mother moved my brother (16) and i into a condo in a small, sixteen-unit condominium complex in northeast ohio from our previous two-story home near columbus. our neighbors were about half retirees, half middle-aged single adults in their late 30's and 40's, and one or two families with one or two minor children. we both attended high-school and college in the area, and i lived there, at least while not living on campus or out of state, until i got married at 28. my wife and i rented an apartment from a large 100-unit apartment complex that just happened to be located directly across the street from our small condo complex, and so we continued to visit the condo, either to host larger parties, work out of the larger garage if necessary, or to spend time with family. five years ago my wife and i started having kids, of which we now have three, ranging from 1 month old to 5 years old. after the second kid our small apartment was getting cramped, and my mother was getting remarried, so we decided to buy the condo from her last year. not only was it more affordable because it was a condo, but i've lived here since i was a kid and i've personally handled nearly all of the tens of thousands in maintenance costs over the years, due to my work as a contractor, so it's already been modified to our preferences. a few months after my mother moved out, we got notice that the board of our 16-unit hoa received a request to convert to an over 55 community and that they were running it by their attorney. i had never heard of this before, but it appears that it's legal to convert if at least 80% of the units have a resident over age 55. with some basic online sleuthing, i was able to determine that due to the younger 30 and 40-something owners moving out or selling over the last 5-10 years, we are now the only unit out of 16 with owners under age 55 (my wife and i both turn 40 next year). we believe the board here was waiting to enact this change as three of the owners are exactly 55 and they would need to have waited for them to cross the 55-year-old threshold in order to move ahead with qualifying for this. despite the owners ages, two owners presently have children. one has a 24 year old adult daughter, and one has a 10 year old minor kid. at least 3-4 owners are in their 80's and 90's. anyway, long story short, we received a second notice that they meet all the legal requirements and the hud survey, and are going to go ahead and vote on this change. they won't tell us who initiated this change, or even why, instead telling us that we can submit our concerns in writing and the hoa attorney will reply. no owners meeting will be held, only a board vote, and all board members are 60-80 years old with no kids. since we're the only owners under 55 we believe it is almost certain to pass. we filed a long list of concerns with the board including our view that even if we're allowed to remain living here, it will noticeably reduce the property and resell value, our kids may not be allowed to host birthday parties or have friends over anymore, and most importantly, may not be allowed to play in the front or back yards, or anywhere outside our walls, which are all technically common areas. the yards here are un-partitioned and stretch for roughly 100 yards, undivided, behind and in front of the units. my brother and i must have played in these yards with our friends thousands of times over the years. unfortunately as the years have gone by and our neighbors have moved out and been replaced by older residents, we've gradually received more complaints about noise, parking, and most recently, our new 58 year old neighbor this summer came running out of her house screaming at us and our kids because she said they had touched her flowers and if they did it again she was going to \"beat their ass\". that being said, i believe in all honesty that we are as a whole generally quieter and more well-behaved than the average family of five. my kids keep to themselves and mostly stay directly behind or in front of our own unit, with minimal screaming. we both work from home and have monitored them all day at times to verify this. would it be legal to restrict our children's use of the yard in such a way? at this choice i feel we have no choice but to hire an attorney, but from my past few weeks of online research, it actually appears that this is a legal form of age discrimination even if we lived here prior to the over 55 conversion. as a gambit end-run around this potential outcome, i deeded all of my children fractional shares in the condo so that they are now also property owners, but i fear the designation of all outside space as common areas places this out of my control and we're going to be at the mercy of a handful of grumpy old people who are perhaps tired of seeing and hearing our kids. does anyone have any experience with anything like this? i mean i could totally understand if the community started as a retirement community but to have the rug swept out from under our feet like this with our childhood home feels terrible. it's exceptionally difficult to find any examples online of existing communities that have converted and then restricted families. almost every post i've come across involves moving into an over-55 community. tldr: our 16-unit condo association is considering converting to over-55 and restricting our kids access to anything outside our home. edited: also wanted to mention that our condo association is situated in the middle of a much large sub-development with several hundred full sized homes, of which hundreds have children. we're directly across from a 100-unit apartment complex with no age restrictions and many kids. the entire other half of our street is duplex townhomes with kids in nearly every single one. our condo

who will go a great distance for a good laugh, as you will see below. i love this story, and we tell it every once in a while, even though it has been more than 20 years. i live in the us and i own an it support company. many years ago, i used a cell phone company named nextel. they had this great push-to-talk feature that turned your phone into a walkie-talkie, which was perfect for communicating with coworkers in my it work. however, their customer service was a nightmare. anytime i needed to contact them, it would take at least 30-40 minutes on hold. eventually, i had to switch to a cheaper service, which meant getting a new number. (now you can port your number to a new carrier, but back then, you had to change numbers if you switched carriers.) i canceled all the phones on our plan except for mine, which i downgraded to an emergency plan costing about $10 a month. i left the old phone plugged in at my office and set my voicemail message to instruct callers of my new number. the phone just sat next to my desk on a shelf, plugged into a charger, so that i could see if anyone called. i could also hear the phone make a sound when it disconnected from the cellular network and then a different sound when it connected to the cellular network. it connected and disconnected constantly there in my office. i would estimate that it only stayed connected to the network about 50% of the time. after six months, i decided to cancel it. i had to wait on hold for the customary 30 to 40 minutes just to cancel my service. after telling the service rep that i was always dropping off the network, and that i had already switched services, they verified the service problems on my account and canceled my entire plan. i wasn't under any contract at the time, so there was no problem canceling my service with nextel. as expected, i got my final bill. it was somewhere around $10 since that was my monthly plan (just the emergency plan, and i didn't make any phone calls). i paid the bill and was happy to be done with that carrier. then, the next month, i got a bill for four cents. yes, just four cents. i figured it was a clerical error and ignored it, expecting them to write it off. but no, each month, another bill for four cents arrived. i was incredulous! i checked the postmark and saw that the postage to send me the bill was costing them ten times more than the bill itself! and they kept sending the bill every month. i could have paid the bill, but it seemed ridiculous to write a check for four cents and spend more on a stamp. after six months, i finally had enough and decided on some very petty, malicious compliance. i decided to invest the 40 minutes on hold to call nextel to work this out. by golly, if they wanted my four cents, i would give them my four cents. i planned to wait on hold for 40 minutes and pay the four cents with a credit card, knowing it would cost them more in fees. i told my wife about my plan, thinking it was the perfect malicious compliance story. but my wife, the true master of malicious compliance, suggested an even better idea: call and ask if i could make payments on the four cents, splitting it into two payments on my credit card. omg! i was in the presence of malicious royalty! i called, waited on hold for 40-45 minutes, and finally got through to a representative. the representative sounded like one of those airport terminal attendants who act like they are checking your reservations, but instead, they are writing a stephen king-length novel. i could hear the clickety-clackety sound of the keyboard. the female representative was constantly typing as i explained that i had canceled my service but kept getting the final bill and proposed making payments. the representative, typing away, said she\u2019d look up my account. as she typed away at her keyboard, i explained that i had gotten the final bill and that i would like to set up a payment plan to take care of the outstanding balance. i told her that i would like to pay half on my credit card today and pay the remaining half the following month. she was agreeing with me and typing away when suddenly she stopped typing and went quiet. \"sir,\" she said. \"yes?\" i replied. \"are you aware of the balance amount?\" \"yes,\" i said. \"four cents???\" she said. \"yes,\" i said. \"i figured that you really wanted that four cents because you keep spending all this postage to send me bills each month. so i'm just calling you to take care of it.\" after a brief silence, i heard the clickety-clack of the keyboard again and she said that i would not have to worry about the balance because she was writing it off. i insisted on giving my credit card for the first half of the payment, but she firmly dismissed it and assured me i wouldn\u2019t get any more bills. my wife's suggestion turned a simple prank into a masterpiece of malicious compliance. i may be good at it, but my wife is on another level! and you really have to want to do malicious compliance to wait on

additional information on this teacher, she hated children, like the type of teacher who yells at kids if they got something incorrectly. for the sake of keeping everything anonymous i'll call her \"mrs. idiot\" and refer to myself as \"me\". with that out of the way to the story i was in first grade and by this time i had a good grasp on how bad my peanut and nut allergy was, always read labels, never eat others home cooked meals and that i shouldn't trust someone just because they say \"i don't think it has nuts in it\" (if you don't know then don't offer those foods to small children who may not know any better). it was first grade and i was having fun coloring something on paper waiting for my teacher. as i was finishing drawing my teacher got out a fun activity worksheet involving candy, if i remember correctly it involved counting or something math related. as she was passing out the worksheets and candy i noticed that they were m&m's, which i'm allergic too. the interaction went something like this. me: \"mrs. idiot i can't have these i'm allergic\" mrs. idiot: \"their orginal m&m's they don't have peanuts in them\" me: \"but my mom says im allergic to the original's too\" mrs. idiot: \"they're fine, you can have them\" to this day i don't know why a teacher would ever tell a kid with allergies to eat something the kid thinks or knows their allergic too. also while original m&m's don't have peanuts or nuts directly in them, they're made on the same equipment as peanut m&m's. this exchange went on for awhile with the idiotic teacher telling me that \"they're fine\" and me saying \"they're not\". i think the teacher actually believed i was purposely trying to annoy her. mrs. idiot: \"if you don't start behaving i'm going to call your mother and you will be in big trouble\" younger me realized that my mom was just going to say the same thing, instead of telling her that i sat there and smiled at the teacher and said \"ok call her\" i remember wondering why the teacher just didn't believe me, looking back that teacher definitely hated being told she was wrong, especially by a 1st grader. the idiot teacher looked annoyed but smug, i guess thinking that my mom would yell at me for not wanting to die or have a giant needle put in my thigh and being rushed to the hospital. now i don't know the full exchange between my mom and the idiot teacher because this was so long ago and my mom doesn't remember what exactly was said, just that she was extremely angry. i know she tore into my teacher because me and everyone who was

to the corner of the room and handed me a bag of skittles, which she apparently had the entire time. it sucked being alone for the activity but i happily did my assignment eating my packet of

luckily for the idiotic teachers case was my moms 2nd draft and had \"nicer\" words in it. that teacher had to do a refresher course on allergies by the nurse (which was shown to her already at the

started to cool down and for the next few months it was buisness as usual. the old store manager had to open another store so they brought in a new one. this one was very professional and quite kind. this store manager always recognized various employees in different departments for their hard work. this recognition of us \"lower employees\" made our karen manager less then happy. i had started to notice a lot more people being hired and everyone's hours suffered because of it. i found out later they did this because part-time employees could be paid less and they wanted to cut costs (tis the life of a retail worker). i wanted to keep making money in preparation for college so i went into karen manager's office and said me: hey, karen manager. i noticed my hours were being cut and i wanted to see if i could pick up some extra shifts. she scoffed at me and said karen manager: it's a department wide decision. if you want hours go to another department. i wouldn't waste your time though. i looked at her confused and asked me: why not? karen manager: they only have hard working employees in their departments. you wouldn't fit in. i was dumbfounded. i thought karen's bs bully routine was over but boy was i wrong. i stood there unsure what to say, meanwhile karen manager had another umbridge smile plastered on her face. i just turned around and walked out of her office. i didn't know if karen manager had already lied to the other managers or not but i might as well ask. i first went to the meat department and explained my situation. i told the manager that our departments hours were being cut and asked if i could do anything to help them out. the meat manager smiled warmly and said meat manager: i understand how frustrating low hours can be. we have a guy on vacation for a few weeks and we have had to stay late to wash all the pans and plates for our meat. it's simple washing and drying. you get to wear headphones within reason and you would make what a starting meat associate would. want the job? i was beaming and immediately took the offer. the job was simple as he promised and i took it seriously. i wanted to show other managers that i was a hard worker and reliable. three weeks passed by with no issue. inevitably their missing associate came back and i had to be let go from that position. luckily i had spoken to the grocery manager the day before and our conversation was somewhat similar. i explained my situation and she understood. she said grocery manager: you just need to tidy up the shelves, put out product on aisle labeled carts, and held unload trucks when they come in. your pay will be a starting grocery associate pay. for context both types of associate pay were an increase from my normal department. i took the offer and immediately helped the grocery department. everything was fine until grocery hired a full time employee and i had to go back to my normal department. i expected buisness as usual but i got one helluva surprise. the first day back karen manager yanked me in her office. the conversation went like this. karen manager: what the hell do you think you are doing, op? i told you our departments hours were cut. me: i know, you said i could try working with other departments. you also said some other nasty things but i don\u2019t care to repeat those. she glared at me and said karen manager: op, you are making our department look bad. we are trying to cut costs and you are burning through hours we don't have. i decided to correct this smug karen and said me: i understand you want to cut costs and you only have so many hours. i didn't take up any extra hours from our department. i took your rude suggestion and worked for other departments that were short staffed and had an abundance of hours. i did nothing wrong. she growled at me and said karen manager: listen op, it's not fair to others in our department if you get full time and other employees don't. i held my ground and said me: this system of hiring tons of part timers is stupid and it's hurting quality full time employees who need the hours. if you insist on hiring all these people there is nothing stopping them from doing exactly what i did. there are plenty of departments that could use help. i was fed up with karen's attitude and spoke my mind karen manager: if you think my management practice is so ridiculous you can just leave! i was tired of her bs and just smiled me: okay i will. i turned in my effects and clocked out. i said by to my friends and drove home. the next day i was enjoying sleeping in for once when i got a phone call. it was the new store manager. i answered me: hello store manager, how are you this morning. store manager: sorry to bother you op but could you come back to the store. i looked over the firing of you yesterday and karen manager was totally out of line. i talked to other managers you have worked for and they all had glowing reviews of your work. we are pretty short staffed and we need you back. me: i smiled (it was always nice to be needed after all). if you transfer me to grocery effective immediately with the pay bump to boot. i will help your department when needed but i want grocery manager as my new boss. store manager: done. i just pulled up your file and transfered you over. you have my word grocery manager is your new boss and karen manager has no authority over you anymore. i will be having a long talk with her over her managerial practices believe me. i smirked and said me: i will see you in ten minutes i drove to the store and walked in. i picked up my effects

sells the property for a higher amount.\u201d this happened 15 years ago and it is one of the proudest moments of my life. my best friend and her husband have 5 kids together. they lived in an expensive city and rented an old 4 bedroom house for $400 per week. the house was very rundown with a disgusting kitchen and stink drains but it was all they could afford at the time. still, they made it work. the owner was a nice old lady who as extremely wealthy and very fond of my friend. she froze the rent for 5 years and promised to let them buy the house once they had saved enough to get a loan from the bank. as she had helped other people in a similar way, they knew they could trust her and so they saved every cent they could. it took them 5 years but they finally told her they were ready.. two days later, the nice old lady passed away; before anything was put in writing. enter the new owners. the lady\u2019s 4 children. each extremely wealthy in their own right; they inherited a huge portfolio of properties. when they first spoke to my friends, they assured them that the sale would still go through but they would have to wait until probate had settled. confident, my friends started making some changes to the place. they started by stripping wallpaper, painting and making plans. finally probate was settled and the owners agreed to go ahead with the sale for the previously agreed price. my friends applied for the loan but to their shock, it was refused. the owners had raised the asking price by $80000 without telling my friends. to make things even worse, the house would be put on the open market. in 7 days there would be an open house and, with the market the way it was, it would probably sell immediately. my friends were devastated. they might be able to borrow enough but it would take longer than a week to get. to make matters worse, property prices and soared recently and rents had gone up a lot whilst theirs had been frozen. not only were my friends going to struggle to get the money. if the place was sold to someone else and they were asked for a higher rent or were evicted, it would be nearly impossible to find an affordable place with more than 2 bedrooms. i was scared for my friends but i was also incandescently angry. those greedy sods were some of the wealthiest people in the city. they were screwing over a struggling family for

cabbage on the stove and we sprayed ammonia around the front and back doors (because it smells like all the neighbourhood cats had been marking their territory). we also poured 2 dozen rotten eggs down the drain to make it smell like sewer gas neighbourhood: we obtained a mouldy old couch and dumped in front yard of the neighbour across the road (with permission of course). neighbourhood x2: we started calling friends for help. anybody with a loud and crappy car was asked to do a few laps in front of the block during the open day. the street was unusually busy that day. everyone we knew found a reason to drive by. it was practically rush hour. neighbourhood x3: we called out mates from the rugby club (full contact football without any of that soft padding). a big portion of our club

lot of people showed up for the open day. quite a few were in and out within minutes. one lady sat in her car and watched the party next door before driving away. the one bloke who stayed any length time, was brave enough to start up a conversation with someone leaving the party. he asked if they were often there and was told every couple of weeks or so, they have an after party morning and the party the night before was 3 doors up. the party goer also helpfully mentioned the troublesome drains that are always getting blocked by tree roots and stinking up the place. the potential buyer left without making an offer. so my friends were the only ones to make an offer. they still had to pay more than they\u2019d planned but not as much as the greed bastards wanted. my friends signed the

of technology in video editing and content creation. i was hired as a content creator for a university that wanted to leverage youtube to kickstart their branding campaign. the pay was low (roughly $2200 usd) and in those days, there were not that many video content creators around and the process usually took a long time from start to finish. i was hired and on my 2nd day, my manager presented my kpi of 85 3-10 minute videos in 52 weeks which was impossible for a one-man team in those days. this meant i had to do the scripting, producing, casting talents, shooting videos, composing music (they were too cheap to pay for a royalty-free music subscription) and editing all of which i had to use my own equipment and software because their cameras and computers were so old, they simply couldn't handle the strain of even doing things in 720p, much less 1080p. i tried to let my manager know but she just smiled encouragingly, telling me to give it a try, assuring me if the videos were good, the quantity would not be what she focused on. hearing this, i agreed to give it a try. my manager treated me well in the first month, however, one day when she found out i was a smoker, her attitude changed overnight. a colleague had actually done a facepalm when i told her about it and she let me know that the manager hated smokers and often advocated to get them fired. she started nitpicking me on everything, from smelling like cigarette smoke after my breaks, coming in 5-10 minutes late despite doing more than 4 hours of overtime daily, not being contactable during break times...the list goes on. but i soldiered on, because i just wanted to do the work and do it well. 5 months in, i was called into the director's office where i saw my manager putting on her best \"displeased but gleeful face\" and i felt my stomach drop. the director told me that she was disappointed because she had heard that i was falling behind on my work, and it was already halfway through the year and i had only completed 30 out of my 85 videos. i tried to explain that i had been working my butt off on these videos, i literally worked 6 days out of the week, over 60 hours just to do what needed to be done and that being a 1 man army made things impossible, and also the fact that the videos i had put up grossed the highest views ever on their youtube page. i also recounted how my manager said that she was looking for quality videos over quantity. the director dismissed this and stated that the kpi was simply 85 videos in a year and since it was almost half a year in with my numbers at less than half, she felt it prudent to cut the cord early. i asked how would they even meet the kpi if they were to fire me now my manager had snorted, saying \"we'll find a professional production house to finish your work.\" the director had given her an odd look but nodded in her support nonetheless, telling me \"you don't need to worry, manager will get the job done.\" that was when a lightbulb went off in my head. seeing as i was the content professional in the office, one of my jobs was to keep a database of production houses to use in the event we needed to do a shoot that required more resources, and i was sure that they would be using the production houses in my database as my manager had no contacts in the production industry. so, i changed the contact numbers and messed up all the emails on all of the entries except one. the one, i had a friend working as a junior director (not an assistant director, but a director assigned to smaller video projects). i gave him a call and told him of my plan, and sure enough within 2 days, they were called to come in to pitch. i told him that i had a plan that was a win-win for us. it would instantly help him and put him on the fast track to a director position by bringing in that much business to his production house and it would also benefit me financially. i would teach him exactly how to pitch to win over the boss and the director and in turn, his company would pay me a standard finders fee of 15%. he agreed instantly and immediately put me on the line with his general manager who upon realizing this was to be 6 months of work for a high 6-digit payout, instantly agreed and drew up a contract. as it turns out, after i gave them a metaphorical \"step-by-step playbook\" they were the \"perfect fit\", somehow understanding the needs and style of the university as well as the sort of themes the university wanted to feature. the director and my former boss were amazed that my friend's production house was so familiar with their content that they signed them up on the spot. now, even back then using a production house back then was not cheap. each video that they produced could cost double to triple my monthly salary given that they had specialized people for each function (producer, director, director of photography, gaffer, sound person, video editor, assistant director, production assistants etc), but this meant that they could complete a video every 2-3 days. so yes, they produced 50 videos in a span of 4 months for over 100 months of my salary and i sat back and collected the healthy 15% which was about 15 months of my salary. this allowed me to put money aside for a holiday and the rest to further my studies with a respected film school overseas. i thought my plan ended here and i had gotten back at my former bosses, but to my surprise, i received a call from my colleague while i was holidaying in bali one day. this was the same colleague who had facepalmed when i told her that my manager had found out that i was a smoker. she told me that my former manager had been fired and my director given a massive blasting by the chancellor of the university. the content creation project which i was hired for was only given a budget equating to about a year and a half of my salary and they had exceeded that budget by over 10 times. my former manager was so desperate to ensure that her content creation project could be completed that she had thrown caution to the wind, paying anything to get the job done so that she could show my director that she had completed the project, and had approved the massive spend without getting consent from the director. so that is how i got my friend a super fast promotion to a full director in his production house, and a year of pay after getting unfairly fired from my job.", "audio": "audios/74.wav", "tokens": ["this happened in the early 2010s, before the advancement of technology in video

financially.", "i would teach him exactly how to pitch to win over the boss and the director and in turn, his company would pay me a standard finders fee of 15%.", "he agreed instantly and immediately

back then was not cheap.", "each video that they produced could cost double to triple my monthly salary given that they had specialized people for each function (producer, director, director of photography, gaffer, sound person, video editor, assistant director, production assistants etc), but this meant that they could complete a video every 2-3 days.", "so yes, they produced 50 videos in a span of 4 months for over 100 months of my salary and i sat back and collected the healthy 15% which was about 15 months of my salary.", "this allowed me to put money aside for a holiday and the rest to further my studies with a respected film school overseas.", "i thought my plan ended here and i had gotten back at my former bosses, but to my surprise, i received a call from my colleague while i was holidaying in bali one day.", "this was the same colleague who had facepalmed when i told her that my manager had found out that i was a smoker.", "she told me that my former manager had been fired and my director given a massive blasting by the chancellor of the university.", "the content creation project which i was hired for was only given a budget equating to about a year and a half of my salary and they had exceeded that budget by over 10 times.", "my former manager was so desperate to ensure that her content creation project could be completed that she had thrown caution to the wind, paying anything to get the job done so that she could show my director that she had completed the project, and had approved the massive spend without getting consent from the director.", "so that is how i got my friend a super fast promotion to a full director in his production house, and a year of pay after getting unfairly fired from my job."]}, "75": {"post": "someone suggested i post this story over here\u2026 enjoy! when our first child was born, my ex forced me to quit my job. when our 2nd child was 2, i found out about his affair. by then he was extremely verbally, emotionally and sometimes physically abusive. when he abused our first born, i put him out. that was in 2012. i couldn\u2019t afford daycare to work and had no family support. he refused to give me any money to take care of the kids saying \u201cthe courts haven\u2019t ordered me to give you a dime!\u201d he lied to the bank and had my accounts frozen and even assaulted me when i filed for default in the divorce. the judge finally ordered him to pay child and spousal support 6 months after i kicked him out. it was 2562 a month. he refused to pay it until the garnishment kicked in and by then he was 6k behind in support. i used that to get permission to move away. i remarried a year after the divorce. i checked the court docs and there was a little box that said spousal support stopped upon remarriage if that box was checked. it wasn\u2019t checked, so i figured i was good. instead of filing for his retirement, i just took that year of spousal support (12k) and left it alone. (spousal support was only ordered for 2 years) in 2017, he filed for sole custody of the kids out of nowhere. that was when he found out i had remarried and he had paid spousal support to me during the first year of my marriage. i told him i took that money instead of filing for my share of his retirement. i said if he let me keep that 12k, i wouldn\u2019t file to split his 401k. he demanded that i repay the spousal support. the judge ordered me to repay it but increased child support and deducted the repayment from that. it ended up that i got an extra 20.00 a month and he repaid himself. he dropped his bid for custody in exchange for 2 extra weeks in summer. i pursued the retirement account split. he refused to cooperate and dragged it out for 4 years. it was so bad, they sanctioned him and he had to pay me 600 a month for a year in addition to child support. they also charged him with contempt. in jan 2021, he proposed to his girlfriend. in may of 2021, i finally got the disbursement from his 401k. i won\u2019t say how much it was, but it was about 4 times the amount of spousal support overpayment. i had no idea it would be that much. i had thought it would be around 12k which is why i thought keeping that year of spousal and not filing for his retirement account was a fair trade. had he not tried to take the kids from me, i never would\u2019ve filed to

said i shouldn\u2019t have \u201cstolen\u201d his money. i told her that i gave him the option to let me keep that year of spousal support or take it back and i could file for his retirement. he chose to have me file for his retirement. i told her that if he really wanted to marry her and protect his assets, they could get a pre-nup so he wouldn\u2019t have to worry about it. she said she shouldn\u2019t have to sign a pre-nup because i \u201crobbed\u201d him. i never asked to be financially dependent on him. he clearly indicated he wanted a court order to take care of his kids so i got

residential landlords are bad, they\u2019re nothing compared to commercial landlords. landlords of commercial buildings are some of the cruelest, nastiest people i\u2019ve ever come across. this revenge tale is about a commercial landlord, and how i dealt with him. back in the 90s, sometimes i\u2019d go for lunch at this restaurant in the basement of our building. the place was called \u201cthe vault\u201d, because it had a massive bank vault that had always been there, dating back to the days before the place was turned into a restaurant. the vault was so huge that they could seat a couple of tables in there, and you could eat dinner surrounded by rows of old, gleaming safe deposit boxes. one day i was there for lunch, and the owner took me aside. \u201cthe landlord\u2019s driving me nuts,\u201d he said. \u201cthe landlord drives everyone nuts.\u201d i was a subtenant in the same building, sharing space with an older lawyer, aaron, and the landlord was always causing us trouble. i\u2019d already had a few run-ins with him, and we hated each other on sight. in most jurisdictions, commercial landlords don\u2019t need court orders to get you out if you're late with the rent. instead, they just change the locks, and you find out about it when you show up and your key doesn\u2019t work. every time our landlord had a dispute with anyone, which was often, he\u2019d always threaten to change the locks. \u201che keeps demanding all this stuff for extra rent, and it\u2019s really weird, because a lot of it\u2019s really old.\u201d the restaurant owner showed me a letter the landlord had served on him earlier that day. i looked over the demand, and read a list of expenses for snow removal and parking lot repair and common area flooring and all kinds of crap going back years. i read it all the way to the end, and there it was, the usual clause saying he was going to change the locks if the tenant didn\u2019t pay this and do that. \u201cfrom the wording of the demand, it looks like you\u2019ve been fighting a while. why did you wait before consulting a lawyer?\u201d \u201ci asked one of the lawyers i know, and he said it\u2019s hopeless.\u201d he told me the lawyer\u2019s name. it was a guy i knew with a shitty real estate practice, who\u2019d resorted to taking little legal aid cases to keep the lights on when the market tanked in \u201889. \u201cyou do something to make the landlord hate you?\u201d i asked, \u201cbecause this is a bit over the top, even for our asshole landlord.\u201d \u201che knows i\u2019m moving the restaurant. i think he\u2019s trying to grab as much money as possible before i go. plus he\u2019s giving me grief over the vault.\u201d \u201che won\u2019t let you take it with you?\u201d \u201care you kidding? it weighs almost a hundred tons, and i don\u2019t need it. but the lease says i have to remove it, and that i also have to restore the building to what it was before there was a vault. that would cost a fortune. the asshole landlord says if i leave the vault behind when i move, he\u2019ll sue.\u201d \u201csend your lease up to my office, and let me look it over,\u201d i said. i finished my lunch, and when i got back to my office the lease was waiting for me. it was just as bad as the restaurant owner said. the lease was a renewal of a renewal of an assignment of a renewal, the original documents dating back to the shortly after w.w.ii when a bank first leased the place and the vault was installed. somehow the landlord had suckered the restaurant into taking over a lease that left him liable to remove a bank vault at the end of term. \u201cno big deal,\u201d i thought, \u201cthe restaurant can default, and all the landlord can do is sue a shell company.\u201d but when i got to the last page of the lease, there was a guarantee clause. the restaurant owner had personally guaranteed the lease, and he was on the hook for removing a vault weighing a hundred tons, and then fixing the place up. it would cost a fortune. the case was hopeless, of course; that was obvious right away. but then i thought about the asshole landlord with his demands and his threats and his rent hikes, and i asked my brain to do me a solid, which it promptly did. i picked up the phone and called the restaurant owner. \u201ci\u2019m fucked, right? you\u2019re calling me to say there\u2019s no way out. that\u2019s what my commercial lawyer already said. but i just thought i\u2019d ask.\u201d \u201ci can save you, but it\u2019s gonna cost.\u201d \u201chow much?\u201d \u201cfive thousand in legals, and another g-note for the agent.\u201d \u201cagent? what kind of agent?\u201d \u201creal estate. send up a cheque, certified, and leave the rest to me.\u201d the cheque hit my desk in less than an hour. i went to aaron\u2019s office. \u201ci need a real estate agent,\u201d i said. \u201cyou buying a house?\u201d \u201cnope.\u201d \u201cselling a house?\u201d \u201cnope.\u201d by this point i\u2019d been sharing space with aaron for almost five years, and he knew me pretty well. \u201cyou pulling one of your stunts again?\u201d he asked. \u201cyup. but nothing that will get you into trouble.\u201d \u201ci know a guy.\u201d aaron knew all kinds of guys, and that\u2019s one of the reasons he eventually got disbarred. but he knew a guy, and he gave me the agent\u2019s name and number, and the next day i paid the agent a visit. i told him what i needed, and we agreed to terms. i gave him some papers and the cash for his fee. a few days later i was again at the vault for lunch. the owner saw me walk in, and greeted me himself. \u201cthe landlord\u2019s here,\u201d he said. \u201cwhy?\u201d \u201cfor lunch, and to be an asshole. let\u2019s sit in the vault room so i don\u2019t have to look at his face.\u201d he took me to the vault room, and with the door almost completely closed, we had a consultation while we ate pasta and drank red wine. \u201cwe\u2019re making demand on the landlord,\u201d i said, munching on spaghetti carbonara. \u201cdemand? what are we demanding?\u201d i pulled a document out of my briefcase and passed it to him while i sipped my wine. \u201cwe\u2019re demanding that the asshole landlord release all the restaurant equipment, all the fixtures. the ovens, the freezers, the ventilation: everything you need to run a restaurant.\u201d \u201cthe lease exempts all that stuff. he can\u2019t stop me taking what i want. the only thing that matters is the vault, and of course i don\u2019t want that.\u201d i shook my head. \u201cyou need the vault,\u201d i said \u201cand we\u2019re demanding that he release the bank vault as well. we\u2019re insisting that he let you take it out within seven business days.\u201d \u201cyou think you can beat the landlord with reverse psychology? you think if you treat him like a two-year old, you can manipulate him into doing what you want?\u201d \u201cwe\u2019ll find out soon enough. he\u2019s had the demand for a couple of days now.\u201d the restaurant owner dropped his wine glass and it shattered on the marble floor. \u201cyou already gave it to him?\u201d the restaurant owner said. he got up, swung open the vault door and called for the waiter to clean up the mess. \u201clet\u2019s see what the landlord has to say,\u201d i told him, and we walked over to the landlord\u2019s table. the landlord was a big, beefy man with a big appetite. he sat alone, eating a rack of lamb wolfishly with his hands. \u201cmy client needs an answer today,\u201d i said. the landlord looked up at me as he chewed noisily. \u201ci\u2019m the vault\u2019s lawyer,\u201d i said. \u201ci gave you a demand the other day. my client needs an answer right now. he needs the vault for a new place, and he\u2019s got to make arrangements.\u201d \u201cyour client can forget about the bank vault,\u201d he said, wiping his massive greasy hands on an already soiled napkin. \u201cbut you can\u2019t do that,\u201d i said. my shock was feigned, but the restaurant owner\u2019s jaw dropped for real. the landlord laughed at us. \u201ci\u2019m the landlord. i can do what i want.\u201d \u201ci\u2019m gonna need that in writing, because my client might sue.\u201d i said. \u201csue all you like,\u201d the landlord told me, \u201csue \u2018till you\u2019re blue in the face.\u201d he told me that i\u2019d have a formal response by day\u2019s end, and then he told me to go away and let him finish his lunch. when the letter arrived from the landlord, claiming ownership over the bank vault, i brought it downstairs and showed it to my client. \u201chow the hell did you do that?\u201d \u201ctrade secret,\u201d i said. the following month the restaurant moved out and the place was empty, and that was too bad, because i had always liked eating at the vault. now the restaurant was in a new location twenty minutes away. they called the new place \u201cthe vault,\u201d and they\u2019d preserved the vibe of the old place. it was very similar, except they didn't have the bank vault. the bank vault, all one hundred tons of it, was where it had always been, in the basement of the building where i rented space. i showed up for work a little after that, and aaron collared me. \u201cthe landlord\u2019s looking for you,\u201d he said. \u201coh yeah? what about?\u201d \u201che\u2019s really angry. he said his deal fell through.\u201d \u201cdeal?\u201d \u201che was supposed to rent the place downstairs to a new tenant, a bank or a credit union or something like that. they were supposed to come in to sign a lease, but they didn\u2019t show up.\u201d \u201cand what\u2019s that got to do with me?\u201d i said to aaron, and i said the same thing again to the landlord when he managed to track me down a couple of days later. \u201ci know you were behind this,\u201d he said, his jowls quivering, \u201ci know it was you. that offer from the agent, it was all bullshit. just a trick to make me keep the vault, so that your client could sneak out of the place and leave that fucking bank vault behind. i\u2019m gonna sue.\u201d \u201cif you\u2019re looking for counsel, i think i\u2019m going to have to declare a conflict.\u201d \u201ci\u2019m gonna sue the restaurant, and that agent, and i\u2019m gonna sue you.\u201d he stormed off. but the landlord didn\u2019t sue. of course he didn\u2019t. he didn\u2019t have a contract to sue on, only a vague letter of intent that i\u2019d drafted, enough to hook a greedy landlord who was used to having his way. the offer he\u2019d received was non-binding, incapable of acceptance without the signing of a formal lease, which of course never got signed. when i left aaron\u2019s place a year later, the

ultimately, he decided that he wanted to keep his mouth shut to avoid getting caught up in the crossfire. i was so miserable in that house. if she were upset at something, she'd stomp around and slam cabinets and doors. if she said or did something terrible and you confronted her the next day, she'd act shocked and say she doesn't remember doing it (as if that makes her less culpable). if my brother bullied me, she wouldn't step in until i started to defend myself. there are humiliating home videos she took of me as a 5-year old pouting in the car while she laughed and kept saying it was because she said took away my desserts. she'd drink as early as noon, and her being drunk made everything so much worse. she badmouthed me to my siblings whenever she felt like i was too fussy, so i started being paranoid about what i did. i would cry alone in my room so much. i remember one time being so sad that i hugged myself, rocked back and forth and told myself \"you'll be okay\" because no one else would. as a young child, i couldn't understand why my mom would get so angry with us. it's only now as an adult i understand that children should be loved no matter how the parent thinks the child should be, and that how my mom treated me had nothing to do with me and everything to do with her. i was an unplanned child and my mom told me she even considered an abortion when she found out she was pregnant, but my dad was so excited to have a daughter that it convinced her to have me. maybe that had something to do with it, but honestly, she messed up all of my siblings in some way. my sisters warned me so early on that once i become a teenager, mom was going to be extra mean. some of them learned being on her side as a flying monkey was better than being a victim. when i cut her off, it meant turning my back on the life i knew for two decades. i don't talk to anyone from our immediate/ extended family or our old church community. the best: when i cut them off, i felt so much relief. i always dreaded being around my family, even my extended family. it felt like i had to play a certain role i either didn't understand or hated, and could never be myself. i'm not beholden to anyone anymore, and all my relationships are ones made from mutual respect and a desire to be around them rather than obligation. my mental health is a lot better. i feel like i'm finally free. the worst: i feel a deep shame when someone asks about my family. my partner's family members will ask about them so innocently, and it hurts to lie or act like nothing is wrong. my partner proposed a month ago and i don't think i can keep it from his parents anymore. a year ago they definitely picked up on the fact that something was wrong. i'm paranoid that my family will try to rope me back into their lives and cause me misery again, even if they genuinely want to make amends. my partner and i agreed to have a courthouse wedding with just his immediate family involved because the idea of a wedding party with only his family feels shameful. i have no idea how to plan for a wedding, which is supposed to be a happy milestone in my life, but without any support i just feel lost. i don't

up with his ex a year or so prior to us meeting but they had been on and off being intimate at random times. they even continued having lunch or dinner together but only when they needed to meet up for the child exchange. we had our ups and downs of course but nothing that we couldn't talk through. i admit, i have my issues when it comes to trust and the trust issues started after he had spent the night at his bm's house for the sake of their kid (this was within the first month of being together). his daughter had been crying at night because of their splitting-up and asked him to spend the night at their old condo. of course this was something i wasn't 100% on board with but again, we had been seeing each other for only a month, if that. so i agreed that he should do whatever he needed to for his child and expressed my boundaries with the situation: i would not be okay if they had sex and to let me know if she initiated it. the entire time, he was reassuring me and even sent me pictures of what he was doing (i didn't ask for pics and felt like he was doing the most when he sent them, but i just brushed it off and trusted what he was telling me). the next morning, he called me and told me how it went. basically said that nothing out of the ordinary happened. they sat down to eat dinner, he tucked his daughter into bed and reassured her that even though mommy and daddy aren't together anymore, doesn't mean that he doesn't love her and he will always love her and none of this is her fault. basic stuff that you say to a kid that's in the middle of a parent break-up. i asked him if his ex initiated intimacy and he said no. fast forward to a month later, he confesses that she did initiate intimacy.

something that i never thought i would find. it ate me up to say the least. i found a conversation with one of his closest friends admitting to him that he was considering freezing his sperm so that

examine a case which i am surprised to find appears never to have been featured on reddit, the unsolved murder of wealthy businessman john luper in 2004, a case which really shook the leeds community at the time and made national headlines in the uk. ~background~ john michael luper was born in 1946 in the city of leeds, west yorkshire to parents stanley luper and his wife olga (nee black). john\u2019s only sibling, younger brother toby who was 8 years younger than john, was born in 1954. in 1981, aged 35, john married turkish-born lyican karabag in leeds, and the couple\u2019s only child, daughter liza-rose, was born in 1983. john came from a well-known jewish family in leeds, and was part of the united hebrew congregation, an orthodox jewish community which worships at a synagogue in the city. his maternal grandfather, isaac (ike) black, was a master tailor in one of the finest workrooms in leeds in the 1940s-50s, when the city was still the hub of the uk textile and suit trade. he was followed into the trade by his son-in-law stanley (john\u2019s father) and son norman (john\u2019s uncle). stanley and norman founded black luper, a textile factory employing hundreds of workers on kirkstall road, near to the famous headingley cricket and rugby grounds, which was for some time the biggest single-story textile factory in the uk and manufactured garments for high-end brands such as burton and burberry. the firm also kitted out the leeds united team that won the 1972 fa cup. both john and toby followed their fathers into the family business. its success and his other ventures, such as in property, made john a millionaire and enabled him to buy a large mansion (worth approximately \u00a31.6million today) in alwoodley on sandmoor drive, one of the most exclusive streets in leeds. here he lived with his wife, daughter and the family au-pair. john was also a non-executive director of the sports entertainment media group and part of the consortium which bought out the business for \u00a39.4m. the group represented sportspeople and celebrities such as thierry henry, rio ferdinand, lennox lewis and jodie marsh. toby, who was very close to his brother, said of john that, \u201che was loyal. he was a great family man. he would help anyone. he would go out of his way to help anyone, sometimes even at his own detriment.\u201d family friends described john as a colourful, forceful character, a \u2018warm-hearted family man who was generous to charities\u2019 and \u2018a larger-than-life character who always had a cheeky grin on his face\u2019 with a passion for sports, particularly football and golf. ~the crime~ on 16 february 2004 john set out from the family home at 11.30pm to walk the family dog. he only got as far as the pavement in front of his neighbour\u2019s driveway on sandmoor drive before he was ambushed by a gang of four or five masked men, who dragged him up the gravel drive, through some bushes and back to the family home. after entering the house john was bound with silver duct tape by the gang. john\u2019s wife, daughter (aged 20 at the time) and the family\u2019s turkish au-pair, who were in bed when the raid began, were also similarly bound and left in an upstairs room, separated from john downstairs. the gang stole john\u2019s wallet, which contained his credit cards and a substantial amount of cash which he had taken out of the bank in preparation for an upcoming business trip. jewellery was also taken, including a number of watches, amongst which was a rare cartier watch, one of only four sold in the uk at the time, made of platinum with vertical rows of diamonds either side of the watch face. estimates suggest that the jewellery and cash totalled approximately \u00a3100k in value. as john lay dying during the raid, an attempt was made by the robbers to feed him marmalade from a jar found in the family kitchen. the robbers, having completed their raid, then fled the home and, on hearing this, the ladies in the upstairs bedroom were able to free themselves from their bindings. on making their way downstairs they found john unconscious on the floor of the morning room. police were called at 1.45am and, despite attempts by emergency services to resuscitate john, he was pronounced dead at the scene in the early hours of 17 february 2004. ~the investigation~ pathologists initially struggled to determine the cause of death for john. it was theorized that, due to the attempts to feed him marmalade, he may have suffered a diabetic attack which caused his death. however, it was eventually determined that he had died from asphyxia and that the marmalade had likely been given to him by the robbers as they became concerned about his health during the raid. police revealed that john had a very mild diabetic condition which did not require medication and it appears that the robbers became aware of this, possibly through john telling them, and in an attempt to boost his sugar levels gave him the marmalade. the mode of asphyxiation john suffered has never been revealed, but police did state that there were only superficial injuries on john\u2019s body and no signs of violence. detectives also revealed that the women had received light injuries, including two having suffered light blows, as the robbers moved them from room to room as they meticulously searched the property for items to steal. despite the lack of major obvious violence involved in the offence detective superintendent bill shackleton of west yorkshire police, who led the initial investigation in 2004, said of the raiders that \u201cthey came there determined to commit this offence. they were equipped to do so, and they knew exactly what they were going to do when they got there, and they were prepared to use a degree of violence.\" ds shackleton confirmed that police believed john and the luper home had been targeted due to wealth rather than any kind of business or personal grudge. all the robbers had worn masks and gloves, and they were believed to have had a getaway car parked a short distance from the luper home. the women in the luper family were able to provide descriptions of two of the robbers. the first was described as a tall, muscular black man with a yorkshire accent, while the second was between 5ft 3in and 5ft 6in, of slight build, and believed to be mixed race or a light-skinned black man. one was described as a somewhat reluctant participant in events, having been overheard by the women as apologising for what was happening and claiming he did not want to be there. however, the women could not be certain if there were four or five robbers in total and this appears to never have been established for certain by police. extensive forensic searches were conducted of the luper home and on sandmoor drive, in particular the area where john was ambushed whilst walking the dog. numerous public appeals for information were made, including a reconstruction of the crime on the nationally broadcast bbc crimewatch programme. efforts were made to trace the jewellery stolen. it has never been made public whether any of this has been recovered but a number of appeals over the 20 years since the crime have focused on the cartier platinum watch so it appears that this rare item in particular is still outstanding. detectives came to believe from information received that the killers were from within the criminal fraternity of the bradford and spen districts. spen is about 17 miles and 35 minutes by car from sandmoor drive, and central bradford approximately 13 miles but around the same travelling time by car due to traffic and road differences. ten months after john\u2019s death, land and farm buildings at the windybank estate near liversedge (2 miles from spen) was searched, but if anything of significance was recovered that information has never been made public and no charges have ever followed. over the years since john\u2019s murder the case continues to be reviewed. since 2017 it has been overseen by the west yorkshire police major investigation review team, a team of specialist cold case investigators. the team undertook a full review of the case, specifically focusing on forensic evidence and any advances over time which could bring new lines of enquiry from the existing forensic material. it appears that nothing of significance has been uncovered by the review team, and appeals continue to be made, including most recently by john\u2019s brother toby and new lead officer detective chief inspector damian roebuck on the 20th anniversary of the crime in february 2024. ~theories~ during the investigation it was revealed that the luper home had been broken into some months prior to the february raid. police learned that john had reportedly told his friends that the robbers in the previous raid had repeatedly demanded diamonds from him. this led police to speculate that both raids were committed by the same gang, who had returned in the belief that diamonds were kept in the home and determined to steal these. whether the luper family did actually own diamonds has never been revealed. it seems clear that police believe the identity of the gang members is known to members of the criminal fraternity in the leeds and bradford areas. it even seems possible that the police themselves are aware of who the robbers likely were, given the raids on the property in liversedge carried out soon after the crime, but have been unable so far to secure enough evidence to prosecute. police appeals continue to focus both on asking for information from people approached and asked to buy jewellery from unknown people or people know who didn't have provenance or receipts for the jewellery, and on the changing of loyalties and allegiances within the community or criminal fraternity over time. this focus suggests some awareness within the police of who likely suspects may be, and a need for more evidence to tie them to the crime. the police have stated publicly that john was targeted for his wealth rather than for a grudge. this may be true, but it seems possible to me that someone with some inside knowledge of the lupers may have been involved in the crime. it is plausible that the family were picked as a target because of their home being on sandmoor drive, and their obvious resultant wealth, but if so why pick that home over any other on the road? to me, the gang seem to have had some information about john and the family which may have come from a degree of insider knowledge. for example, 11.30pm at night is a fairly unusual time to walk a dog so how did the raiders know this would be a good time to ambush john? they could have gained such knowledge from watching the family home for some time and learning their routines (if indeed such a late-night walk was routine for john) but the layout of the road and the security conscious nature of people in a wealthy neighbourhood would have made anyone spending any time watching a home fairly conspicuous. in addition, why did the raiders think that there were diamonds in the luper home? could this have been from some (possibly incorrect) inside information. and if the raiders were from the bradford/spen area how did they come to target the lupers at all it is, after all, some distance to the alwoodley area of leeds from this area so how did they become aware of the luper family and why would they not have focussed on similarly wealthy targets closer to home? it is possible the information made its way to them through a criminal network, but it seems to me more likely that some insider information may have been in play. i stress this is purely a theory of mine based on deduction and has never been suggested to my knowledge by police. ~discussion points~ how do you think the lupers may have come to be targeted for this crime? and what do you think the chances are of it ever being solved now, given that the information the police need seems most likely to come from within the criminal fraternity? ~sources~

"103": {"post": "this is my first post on reddit, let alone this sub! i hope it meets the requirements. for my first post i wanted to focus on a case which is close to my heart the disappearance and murder in 1994 of lindsay jo rimer. lindsay jo rimerlindsay jo rimer was born on the 17th february 1981 to parents geraldine (geri) and colin rimer. lindsay lived with her parents, older brother daniel, older sister kate and younger sister juliet at a house on cambridge street in the town of hebden bridge, situated in the northern county of west yorkshire in the uk and made famous recently as the setting for bafta winning bbc drama series happy valley. lindsay was described by her mother geri as a \u2018well-behaved, conscientious and happy kid\u2019, a girl so well organised and efficient that her family nicknamed her saffy, after the character in british sitcom absolutely fabulous who displayed the same traits. she was a conscientious and popular student in year 9 at the local calder high school, and had expressed an interest in going to university to attain a degree once her high school education was completed. lindsay had recently taken on a part-time job at local forbuoys newsagents delivering newspapers to earn some money, at least in part to fund what her mum described as a developing interest in fashion. lindsay\u2019s home life had not always been easy though. the family-run pub in rotherham had gone bust and subsequently, under the strain of the resultant financial problems, her parents had separated. following this lindsay, her brother daniel and father colin lived separately from the rest of the family in caravans at lower rough head farm, hebden bridge. for two years lindsay and daniel shared one caravan and colin lived in another at the farm. whilst daniel apparently quite enjoyed the country lifestyle, and sometimes returned to help the farmer (he was sheep dipping the day before lindsay\u2019s disappearance), lindsay appears to have been less keen on it and missed her friends. however, her parents eventually reconciled and the whole family was once again living together again by the time lindsay disappeared in november 1994. ~lindsey goes missing~on the evening of 7th november 1994 lindsay was at home with colin. her sister kate was 20 at the time and had already left home. presumably, although it is not clear from information in the public domain, daniel and juliet (only a toddler at the time) were also at home on this evening. at approximately 10pm lindsay left the house on cambridge street to go to a shop and buy a packet of cornflakes while her father colin was having a conversation on the telephone which commenced at 9.45pm, and so no words passed between them. on the way to the shop lindsay visited the trades club in holme street, where her mum geri was out having a drink with a friend. geri offered to buy lindsay a coke, but lindsay refused and left to continue her journey to the shop. cctv at the spar supermarket on crown street captures lindsay buying a packet of cornflakes at 10.22pm. this is the last footage of lindsay alive and she appears to be acting completely normally, with no hint of any concerns. nor is she carrying anything, such as a bag, other than the packet of cornflakes she had set out to buy. lindsay never made it home, although this fact went unnoticed till the morning of the 8th november as geri had been out for the evening and, in her own words, made the \u2018mistake of my life\u2019 by not checking lindsay had returned when she got home. colin had been on the telephone from 9.45-10.20pm and had also not been aware of his daughter\u2019s failure to return. on the morning of 8th november forbuoys newsagents called the rimer home as lindsay had failed to turn up for her morning newspaper delivery round, and it was at this point that the alarm was raised. ~search and discovery~despite family and friends strongly arguing that lindsay was not the type of girl who would leave home, police initially believed it was likely that she was a runaway, speculating that she was unhappy at home (this was denied by her family). despite this initial belief, there was an investigation unit set up, and extensive appeals and searches took place. lindsay\u2019s older sister kate played the role of her sister in a televised reconstruction of lindsay\u2019s last known movements in the hope this would jog memories but the police received little useful information as a result. hundreds of local people joined searches of the area and some parts of the rochdale canal and river calder were also searched, but to no avail. lindsay\u2019s family participated in a channel 4 documentary called deadline in the hope this would help generate information about their daughter\u2019s whereabouts. however, the documentary caused more problems for the family when the demeanor of colin was questioned. he was observed by some viewers to be \u2018smirking\u2019 and too happy/jolly given his situation, and some started to suspect he was in some way involved with his daughter\u2019s disappearance. his wife geri supported him unequivocally, and outlined how behind closed doors colin was an emotional wreck, but his way of coping with the events was to put on a brave face and happy demeanor in public, as well as his observed \u2018smirking\u2019 being a result of nerves at being in front of the camera. the police do not believe colin was involved in his daughter\u2019s disappearance. ~lindsay is found~in the late morning of the 12 april 1995, five months after lindsay went missing, her body was found by canal workers dredging rawden mill lock 12 of the rochdale canal approximately one mile from the centre of hebden bridge. police admitted that the section of canal where the remains were found had not been part of earlier searches of the canal, a crucial mistake made as the police had failed to search 'upstream' from lindsay's home, and one which would cost the investigation a heavy price. lindsay\u2019s body had been weighed down with a 20lb concrete boulder, the boulder having been taken from the side of the canal by the killer. it appears from an foi request submitted to west yorkshire police in 2021 that the boulder was secured to her remains by rope, though i cannot find confirmation elsewhere that this was the case. where the rope came from, if this was so, is unclear perhaps the killer brought it with them, suggesting some form of premeditation, or perhaps this also was found by the killer close to the canal. lindsay was still wearing the same clothing she was pictured wearing in the cctv footage taken at the spar on the night she disappeared. lindsay\u2019s remains were taken to the royal halifax infirmary for post-mortem by home office pathologist professor mike green, assisted by dr naomi carter. the pathologist concluded that lindsay had died as a result of strangulation, with the larynx slightly flattened against the spinal column and \u2018a prominent band of congestion across the middle area of the neck muscles\u2019 (halifax courier article from 2000, quoted on hebweb). much of the content of the report has been kept confidential for investigative reasons, including information on the arrangement of lindsay\u2019s clothing when she was found, but the police did advise that no sexual assault was believed to have taken place. ~the investigation~detectives believe that lindsay was murdered the night she disappeared, and that she had already been placed in the canal by the time she was reported missing on the morning of 8th november 1994. the part of the canal where her remains were found is situated fairly close to the rimer family home, and so the police believed it likely that lindsay was picked up by someone in a car on her walk home from the spar shop, probably someone she knew given that she was believed to be a sensible and cautious girl who was unlikely to get into a car with a stranger. police speculated that, whilst it was likely she knew her killer, lindsay could have met him as recently as a few nights before her death, at a bonfire night celebration in the town on 5th november. close to the area of the canal where her remains were discovered was a working mill factory, now long since closed and demolished, where detectives theorized the killer, sexually attracted to lindsay, had taken her with the aim of some form of liaison and, when rejected, he killed her, possibly by mistake. in the three decades since lindsay\u2019s murder police have spoken to over 5000 people, taken hundreds of witness statements and examined over 1200 vehicles. lindsay\u2019s murder was investigated as part of operation enigma, a national enquiry that reviewed the unsolved murders of 207 women across britain, which eliminated any link between lindsay\u2019s murder and others. in 2016, police confirmed that a dna profile, believed to be that of lindsay\u2019s killer, had been isolated by a team of canadian forensics specialists. two arrests were made in 2016 and 2017, but neither man has been charged and given the availability of a dna sample to test against it appears likely they have been eliminated. ~theories~police clearly believe that lindsay was killed by someone she knew, but other possibilities have investigated or proposed by outsiders over the years, and i have summarized the main theories below: 'honda man' police discovered that a red honda civic stolen in meanwood, near leeds, on 6th november had been spotted several times in hebden bridge near where lindsay had last been seen and was again seen in the town during the evening of 12th november. an e-fit was produced of the driver, described as a bearded male, and police attempted to trace both him and the vehicle. they discovered honda man had tried to talk to a number of teenage girls in the town around the time of lindsay\u2019s disappearance, including some of lindsay\u2019s school friends. he was spotted near the spar shop where lindsay was last seen alive. the car was found abandoned in sheffield ten days after lindsay\u2019s disappearance. recent appeals in 2024 have focused on possible links between the murder and the red honda, suggesting that police think the man in the car may have had a role to play in lindsay\u2019s death. john taylor taylor was convicted of the murder of leeds schoolgirl leanne tiernan following her murder in november 2000 and a series of rapes. he is also a suspect in a number of other murders in the west yorkshire area. police have investigated him in lindsay\u2019s case but no evidence has linked him to her murder. john oswin oswin, from halifax in west yorkshire, was given an was given an indefinite life sentence after he pled guilty to two rapes and two indecent assaults involving teenage girls in the halifax area from december 1993 to september 1997. at least one incident occurred along a canal towpath a commonality with lindsay\u2019s case, and hebden bridge is only 9 miles from halifax. again, police investigated but could not link him to lindsay\u2019s case. tony king in 2003 the press reported that police were investigating the so-called costa killer and holloway strangler, and had sought his dna, in lindsay\u2019s case. however, police described this as \u2018speculation\u2019. jimmy savile one of the more outlandish theories about lindsay\u2019s murder is that it was committed by notorious celebrity sex offender savile. the suggestion comes about as a result of savile apparently regularly staying at a friend\u2019s caravan situated at cragg vale, a mile from lower rough head farm where lindsay lived with her father and brother for two years, and savile renting a garage in the town to park his rolls royce. in the month lindsay went missing savile\u2019s whereabouts are unconfirmed and he was absent from the public eye, adding to the speculation of a link. however, the link seems tenuous at best. francisco arce montes in 2007 true crime author wensley clarkson claimed in his book the predator: portrait of a serial killer that montes, killer of 13-year-old british schoolgirl caroline dickinson murdered while she slept in a hostel in france, was responsible for lindsay\u2019s murder. clarkson claimed that he was told by a retired police officer that montes, working as a waiter in london in 1994, had visited york and was on a hunting trip in the west yorkshire area on the date of lindsay\u2019s disappearance. however, clarkson has never been able to provide any evidence to back up the claims and refuses to name the officer he says gave him this information. vince robson in 2017 a retired detective from cleveland police claimed that vince robson, a man questioned in relation to the murders of julie hogg and tina bell, had links to the rimer family and the hebden bridge area. robson moved to hebden bridge in 1990 and worked at the trades club, the place lindsay visited to see her mum geri on her way to the spar shop. robson is purportedly one of the last people to see lindsay alive on the night she disappeared, and the detective concerned believes he should be a prime suspect. these claims were explored further in channel 4 documentary in the footsteps of killers. sources ~https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/murder_of_lindsay_rimer#cite_note-times95-5~

and had expressed an interest in going to university to attain a degree once her high school education was completed.", "lindsay had recently taken on a part-time job at local forbuoys newsagents

family).", "despite this initial belief, there was an investigation unit set up, and extensive appeals and searches took place.", "lindsay\u2019s older sister kate played the role of her sister in a televised reconstruction of lindsay\u2019s last known movements in the hope this would jog memories but the police received little useful information as a result.", "hundreds of local people joined searches of the area and some parts of the rochdale canal and river calder were also searched, but to no avail.", "lindsay\u2019s family participated in a channel 4 documentary called deadline in the hope this would help generate information about their daughter\u2019s whereabouts.", "however, the documentary caused more problems for the family when the demeanor of colin was questioned.", "he was

geri supported him unequivocally, and outlined how behind closed doors colin was an emotional wreck, but his way of coping with the events was to put on a brave face and happy demeanor in public, as

found~in the late morning of the 12 april 1995, five months after lindsay went missing, her body was found by canal workers dredging rawden mill lock 12 of the rochdale canal approximately one mile from the centre of hebden bridge.", "police admitted that the section of canal where the remains were found had not been part of earlier searches of the canal, a crucial mistake made as the police had failed to search 'upstream' from lindsay's home, and one which would cost the investigation a heavy price.", "lindsay\u2019s body had been weighed down with a 20lb concrete boulder, the boulder having been taken from the side of the canal by the killer.", "it appears from an foi request submitted to west yorkshire police in 2021 that the boulder was secured to her remains by rope, though i cannot find confirmation elsewhere that this was the case.", "where the rope came from, if this was so, is unclear perhaps the killer brought it with them, suggesting some form of premeditation, or perhaps
